Responses of soil organic carbon to climate extremes under warming across global biomes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01874-3,nature_articles/images_2023/Responses of soil organic carbon to climate extremes under warming across global biomes.jpg,"Warming temperatures associated with climate change are expected to impact soil carbon stocks, yet the effect of more frequent and intense extreme climate events on soil carbon is yet unclear. This study shows that most extremes enhance soil carbon loss globally, with variation across ecosystems.","Mingming Wang, Shuai Zhang, Zhongkui Luo",No publication date,Article,"The impact of more extreme climate conditions under global warming on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics remains unquantified. Here we estimate the response of SOC to climate extreme shifts under 1.5 °C warming by combining a space-for-time substitution approach and global SOC measurements (0–30 cm soil). Most extremes (22 out of 33 assessed extreme types) exacerbate SOC loss under warming globally, but their effects vary among ecosystems. Only decreasing duration of cold spells exerts consistent positive effects, and increasing extreme wet days exerts negative effects in all ecosystems. Temperate grasslands and croplands negatively respond to most extremes, while positive responses are dominant in temperate and boreal forests and deserts. In tundra, 21 extremes show neutral effects, but 11 extremes show negative effects with stronger magnitude than in other ecosystems. Our results reveal distinct, biome-specific effects of climate extremes on SOC dynamics, promoting more reliable SOC projection under climate change."
Increase in MJO predictability under global warming,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01885-0,nature_articles/images_2023/Increase in MJO predictability under global warming.jpg,"The Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a key feature of tropical weather on a multi-weekly timescale. Here, the authors show that the MJO becomes more predictable with climate change, potentially allowing better subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasting.","Danni Du, Aneesh C. Subramanian, Elizabeth Bradley",No publication date,Article,"The Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a dominant source of subseasonal atmospheric variability in the tropics and significantly impacts global weather and climate predictability. Changes in its activity and predictability due to human-induced global climate change have profound implications for future global weather prediction. Here we investigate changes in MJO predictability in reanalysis and climate model data and find that MJO predictability has increased over the past century. This increase can be attributed to anthropogenic warming and continues during the twenty-first century in projections. The increased predictability is accompanied by stronger MJO amplitude, more regular oscillation patterns and organized eastward propagation under global warming. Our results suggest that greenhouse warming will increase the predictability of the MJO, with far-reaching consequences for global weather prediction."
The soil microbiome governs the response of microbial respiration to warming across the globe,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01868-1,nature_articles/images_2023/The soil microbiome governs the response of microbial respiration to warming across the globe.jpg,"The authors use experimental data from 332 sites across all major global biomes to evaluate the drivers of soil microbial respiration response to warming. They demonstrate a key role of the soil microbiome, highlighting the need to account for this in assessments of soil respiration under change.","Tadeo Sáez-Sandino, Pablo García-Palacios, Manuel Delgado-Baquerizo",No publication date,Article,"The sensitivity of soil microbial respiration to warming (Q10) remains a major source of uncertainty surrounding the projections of soil carbon emissions to the atmosphere as the factors drivingQ10patterns across ecosystems have been assessed in isolation from each other. Here we report the results of a warming experiment using soils from 332 sites across all continents and major biomes to simultaneously evaluate the main drivers of globalQ10patterns. Compared with biochemical recalcitrance, mineral protection, substrate quantity and environmental factors, the soil microbiome (that is, microbial biomass and bacterial taxa) explained the largest portion of variation inQ10values. Our work provides solid evidence that soil microbiomes largely govern the responses of soil heterotrophic respiration to warming and thus need to be explicitly accounted for when assessing land carbon–climate feedbacks."
Recent irreversible retreat phase of Pine Island Glacier,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01887-y,nature_articles/images_2023/Recent irreversible retreat phase of Pine Island Glacier.jpg,"It has been suggested that Antarctic ice sheets can become unstable and undergo irreversible retreat, but so far observational evidence for this mechanism is missing. Here, the authors show evidence that such an irreversible retreat occurred at Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica in the 1970s.","Brad Reed, J. A. Mattias Green, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson",No publication date,Article,"Pine Island Glacier (PIG), a part of the West Antarctic marine ice sheet, has recently undergone substantial changes including speed up, retreat and thinning. Theoretical arguments and modelling work suggest that marine ice sheets can become unstable and undergo irreversible retreat. Here, we use an ice-flow model validated by observational data to show that a rapid PIG retreat in the 1970s from a subglacial ridge to an upstream ice plain was self-enhancing and irreversible. The results suggest that by the early 1970s, the retreat of PIG had reached a point beyond which its original position at the ridge could not be recovered, even during subsequent periods of cooler ocean conditions. The irreversible phase ended by the early 1990s after almost 40 km of retreat and 0.34 mm added to global mean sea level, making PIG the main contributor from the Antarctic ice sheet in this period."

Fast upper-level jet stream winds get faster under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01884-1,nature_articles/images_2023/Fast upper-level jet stream winds get faster under climate change.jpg,"Climate change is expected to strengthen atmospheric jet streams. Here the authors show that the fastest upper-level jet stream winds accelerate about 2.5 times faster under climate change than average winds, which could influence aviation and severe weather events.","Tiffany A. Shaw, Osamu Miyawaki",No publication date,Article,"Earth’s upper-level jet streams influence the speed and direction of travel of weather systems and commercial aircraft, and are linked to severe weather occurrence. Climate change is projected to accelerate the average upper-level jet stream winds. However, little is known about how fast (>99th percentile) upper-level jet stream winds will change. Here we show that fast upper-level jet stream winds get faster under climate change using daily data from climate model projections across a hierarchy of physical complexity. Fast winds also increase ~2.5 times more than the average wind response. We show that the multiplicative increase underlying the fast-get-faster response follows from the nonlinear Clausius–Clapeyron relation (moist-get-moister response). The signal is projected to emerge in both hemispheres by 2050 when considering scenario uncertainty. The results can be used to explain projected changes in commercial flight times, record-breaking winds, clear-air turbulence and a potential increase in severe weather occurrence under climate change."
Inequality repercussions of financing negative emissions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01870-7,nature_articles/images_2023/Inequality repercussions of financing negative emissions.jpg,"Negative emissions technologies at scale are seen as essential for the overall decarbonization effort to achieve the Paris Agreement targets. However, private ownership of these technologies could largely increase regional or international inequality by financing them through carbon markets.","Pietro Andreoni, Johannes Emmerling, Massimo Tavoni",No publication date,Article,"Negative emissions technologies are attracting the interest of investors in the race to make them effective and profitable. When deployed at scale, they will be financed through public funds, reducing the fiscal space for a socially inclusive climate transition. Moreover, if the private sector owns negative emissions technologies, potentially large profits would disproportionally benefit investors and equity holders. Here we quantify the inequality repercussions of direct air capture of CO2in a 1.5 °C scenario, using a regional integrated assessment model that features within-country income heterogeneity. We find that, under a single carbon market, financing negative emissions technologies could double the increase in income inequality of climate policy. The effects are highest around the time of net zero and in scenarios with carbon budget overshoot. We identify the drivers of the inequality increase and discuss policy provisions to mitigate the equity concerns of CO2removal strategies."
A constraint on historic growth in global photosynthesis due to rising CO2,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01867-2,nature_articles/images_2023/A constraint on historic growth in global photosynthesis due to rising CO2.jpg,"The authors incorporate terrestrial biosphere models with ecological optimality theory, remote sensing and global carbon budget estimates to constrain the historical effects of CO2 on photosynthesis. They show that CO2 fertilization likely increased global photosynthesis by 13.5% between 1981 and 2020.","T. F. Keenan, X. Luo, S. Zhou",No publication date,Article,"Theory predicts that rising CO2increases global photosynthesis, a process known as CO2fertilization, and that this is responsible for much of the current terrestrial carbon sink. The estimated magnitude of the historic CO2fertilization, however, differs by an order of magnitude between long-term proxies, remote sensing-based estimates and terrestrial biosphere models. Here we constrain the likely historic effect of CO2on global photosynthesis by combining terrestrial biosphere models, ecological optimality theory, remote sensing approaches and an emergent constraint based on global carbon budget estimates. Our analysis suggests that CO2fertilization increased global annual terrestrial photosynthesis by 13.5 ± 3.5% or 15.9 ± 2.9 PgC (mean ± s.d.) between 1981 and 2020. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates of the historic sensitivity of global terrestrial photosynthesis to CO2and highlight the large impact anthropogenic emissions have had on ecosystems worldwide."
Loss-of-function gs3 allele decreases methane emissions and increases grain yield in rice,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01872-5,nature_articles/images_2023/Loss-of-function gs3 allele decreases methane emissions and increases grain yield in rice.jpg,"Rice paddies are a source of the potent greenhouse gas methane.

To meet the food demand of the growing population and to cope with global warming, reducing greenhouse gases and enhancing yields are critical. Here we demonstrate that a loss-of-function rice allele,gs3, mitigates methane emissions from methanogens by allocating more photosynthates to the grain and less to the root and increases yield by enlarging grain size and weight."
"Community forest governance and synergies among carbon, biodiversity and livelihoods",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01863-6,nature_articles/images_2023/Community forest governance and synergies among carbon_ biodiversity and livelihoods.jpg,"Forest restoration is emerging as a key climate mitigation strategy. In this study, the authors find that formalized local control and substantive involvement in rule-making are associated with synergies for carbon sequestration, biodiversity and rural livelihoods.","Harry W. Fischer, Ashwini Chhatre, Arun Agrawal",No publication date,Article,"Forest landscape restoration has emerged as a key strategy to sequester atmospheric carbon and conserve biodiversity while providing livelihood co-benefits for indigenous peoples and local communities. Using a dataset of 314 forest commons in human-dominated landscapes in 15 tropical countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, we examine the relationships among carbon sequestered in above-ground woody biomass, tree species richness and forest livelihoods. We find five distinct clusters of forest commons, with co-benefits and trade-offs on multiple dimensions. The presence of a formal community management association and local participation in rule-making are consistent predictors of multiple positive outcomes. These findings, drawn from a range of contexts globally, suggest that empowered local forest governance may support multiple objectives of forest restoration. Our analysis advances understanding of institutional aspects of restoration while underscoring the importance of analysing the interconnections among multiple forest benefits to inform effective interventions for multifunctional tropical forests."

Mycorrhizal type regulates trade-offs between plant and soil carbon in forests,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01864-5,nature_articles/images_2023/Mycorrhizal type regulates trade-offs between plant and soil carbon in forests.jpg,"The impact of climate change on soil carbon remains uncertain. This study shows that soil carbon in forests increases in response to elevated CO2, but the response to warming and nitrogen deposition depends on mycorrhizal associations, indicating a trade-off between soil and plant carbon.","Kai Yang, Qian Zhang, G. Geoff Wang",No publication date,Article,"Forest ecosystems store ~80% of the carbon in terrestrial ecosystems, but their long-term carbon sequestration depends partly on how plant biomass and soil carbon stocks will respond to global changes. Although the stimulation of plant growth by global change drivers has been widely observed, the response of soil carbon stock to global changes remains uncertain. Here we conducted a meta-analysis on experimental observations of plant and soil carbon-related data worldwide. We found that plant biomass and soil carbon stock increased more under elevated CO2than under nitrogen deposition and warming. Under nitrogen deposition and warming, soil carbon stock depended on mycorrhizal associations, decreasing in forests dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species while increasing in forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal tree species. These results suggest a mycorrhizae-mediated trade-off between plant biomass and soil carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems under nitrogen deposition and warming conditions."

Human rights can be a valuable framing for calling attention to and addressing loss and damage, but there remains limited scholarship so far. Here we explore how climate change is impinging on the rights of Ni-Vanuatu and what can be done in response. Our findings show that loss and damage to fundamental rights is already occurring and will worsen, undermining the right to a life of dignity. The future loss and damage fund, and other initiatives, should integrate a human rights restoration package that includes recording and safeguarding Indigenous knowledge, promoting cultural continuity, restoring the socio-ecological system, building back better and investing in education."
Thunderstorm straight line winds intensify with climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01852-9,nature_articles/images_2023/Thunderstorm straight line winds intensify with climate change.jpg,"Non-tornadic thunderstorm winds are associated with particularly strong damages. Here, the author assesses changes in these winds in the central USA and shows that they have intensified stronger than other extreme winds over the past decades, while the affected area increased 4.8-fold.",Andreas F. Prein,No publication date,Article,"Straight line winds (SLWs), or non-tornadic thunderstorm winds, are causing widespread damage in many regions around the world. These powerful gusts are associated with strong downdraughts in thunderstorms, rear inflow jets and mesovortices. Despite their significance, our understanding of climate change effects on SLWs remains limited. Here, focusing on the central USA, a global hot spot for SLWs, I use observations, high-resolution modelling and theoretical considerations to show that SLWs have intensified over the past 40 years. Theoretical considerations suggest that SLWs should intensify at a rate of ~7.5% °C−1, yet the observed rates show a more pronounced increase of ~13% °C−1. The simulation results indicate a 4.8 ± 1.2-fold increase in the geographical extent affected by SLWs during the study period. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating intensifying SLWs into climate change adaptation planning to ensure the development of resilient future infrastructure."
Distributional labour challenges and opportunities for decarbonizing the US power system,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01802-5,nature_articles/images_2023/Distributional labour challenges and opportunities for decarbonizing the US power system.jpg,"The low-carbon transition would bring both challenges and opportunities for the labour market, which have important implications for a just transition.

Studies of these distributional labour impacts could benefit from tighter linkages between energy and employment modelling. Here, we couple a power-sector optimization model, an employment impact model and demographic databases to understand state-level job characteristics and the societal implications of low-carbon transitions in the US. Although decarbonization brings consistent job growth, it heightens the need for investment in human capital and supply chain restructuring. Major fossil fuel-producing states need to prepare for fewer mining jobs under the US Long-Term Strategy, so other opportunities should be created or seized. The lowest-skilled workers will experience more uncertain employment outcomes. Expanding renewable energy could improve opportunities for women in fossil fuel-dependent states, but not enough to disrupt the national gender status quo. This work provides a new quantitative perspective to inform proactive just transition policies."
Assessing the size and uncertainty of remaining carbon budgets,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01848-5,nature_articles/images_2023/Assessing the size and uncertainty of remaining carbon budgets.jpg,The remaining carbon budget (RCB) is a critical estimate of the carbon that can be emitted while staying within a particular temperature threshold. This study provides an updated assessment of the RCB using recent data and robustness checks to increase confidence in the estimate.,"Robin D. Lamboll, Zebedee R. J. Nicholls, Joeri Rogelj",No publication date,Article,"The remaining carbon budget (RCB), the net amount of CO2humans can still emit without exceeding a chosen global warming limit, is often used to evaluate political action against the goals of the Paris Agreement. RCB estimates for 1.5 °C are small, and minor changes in their calculation can therefore result in large relative adjustments. Here we evaluate recent RCB assessments by the IPCC and present more recent data, calculation refinements and robustness checks that increase confidence in them. We conclude that the RCB for a 50% chance of keeping warming to 1.5 °C is around 250 GtCO2as of January 2023, equal to around six years of current CO2emissions. For a 50% chance of 2 °C the RCB is around 1,200 GtCO2. Key uncertainties affecting RCB estimates are the contribution of non-CO2emissions, which depends on socioeconomic projections as much as on geophysical uncertainty, and potential warming after net zero CO2."
Climate change exacerbates nutrient disparities from seafood,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01822-1,nature_articles/images_2023/Climate change exacerbates nutrient disparities from seafood.jpg,"The authors use fisheries databases and predictive models to understand past and future changes in the availability of iron, calcium omega-3 and protein from seafood. They show disproportional loss of nutrients in tropical low-income countries, which will be exacerbated by higher levels of global warming.","William W. L. Cheung, Eva Maire, Christina C. Hicks",No publication date,Article,"Seafood is an important source of bioavailable micronutrients supporting human health, yet it is unclear how micronutrient production has changed in the past or how climate change will influence its availability. Here combining reconstructed fisheries databases and predictive models, we assess nutrient availability from fisheries and mariculture in the past and project their futures under climate change. Since the 1990s, availabilities of iron, calcium and omega-3 from seafood for direct human consumption have increased but stagnated for protein. Under climate change, nutrient availability is projected to decrease disproportionately in tropical low-income countries that are already highly dependent on seafood-derived nutrients. At 4oC of warming, nutrient availability is projected to decline by ~30% by 2100 in low income countries, while at 1.5–2.0oC warming, decreases are projected to be ~10%. We demonstrate the importance of effective mitigation to support nutritional security of vulnerable nations and global health equity."
Unavoidable future increase in West Antarctic ice-shelf melting over the twenty-first century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01818-x,nature_articles/images_2023/Unavoidable future increase in West Antarctic ice-shelf melting over the twenty-first century.jpg,"The authors use a regional ocean model to project ocean-driven ice-shelf melt in the Amundsen Sea.

Using a regional ocean model, we present a comprehensive suite of future projections of ice-shelf melting in the Amundsen Sea. We find that rapid ocean warming, at approximately triple the historical rate, is likely committed over the twenty-first century, with widespread increases in ice-shelf melting, including in regions crucial for ice-sheet stability. When internal climate variability is considered, there is no significant difference between mid-range emissions scenarios and the most ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement. These results suggest that mitigation of greenhouse gases now has limited power to prevent ocean warming that could lead to the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet."
Forest composition change and biophysical climate feedbacks across boreal North America,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01851-w,nature_articles/images_2023/Forest composition change and biophysical climate feedbacks across boreal North America.jpg,"Wildfire can lead to shifts in forest composition to more deciduous tree cover, which can have a biophysical cooling effect on climate.

Rogers, Scott J. Goetz",No publication date,Article,"Deciduous tree cover is expected to increase in North American boreal forests with climate warming and wildfire. This shift in composition has the potential to generate biophysical cooling via increased land surface albedo. Here we use Landsat-derived maps of continuous tree canopy cover and deciduous fractional composition to assess albedo change over recent decades. We find, on average, a small net decrease in deciduous fraction from 2000 to 2015 across boreal North America and from 1992 to 2015 across Canada, despite extensive fire disturbance that locally increased deciduous vegetation. We further find near-neutral net biophysical change in radiative forcing associated with albedo when aggregated across the domain. Thus, while there have been widespread changes in forest composition over the past several decades, the net changes in composition and associated post-fire radiative forcing have not induced systematic negative feedbacks to climate warming over the spatial and temporal scope of our study."

We show with medium confidence that today’s global coastal adaptation is halfway to the full adaptation potential. Urban archetypes generally score higher than rural ones (with a wide spread of local situations), adaptation efforts are unbalanced across the assessment dimensions and strategizing for long-term pathways remains limited. The results provide a multi-dimensional and locally grounded assessment of global coastal adaptation and lay new foundations for international climate negotiations by showing that there is room to refine global adaptation targets and identify priorities transcending development levels."

Despite a rising awareness that adaptation should involve diverse societal actors and a shared sense of responsibility, little is known about the types of actors, such as state and non-state, and their roles in different types of adaptation responses as well as in different regions. Based on a largen-structured analysis of case studies, we show that, although individuals or households are the most prominent actors implementing adaptation, they are the least involved in institutional responses, particularly in the global south. Governments are most often involved in planning and civil society in coordinating responses. Adaptation of individuals or households is documented especially in rural areas, and governments in urban areas. Overall, understanding of institutional, multi-actor and transformational adaptation is still limited. These findings contribute to debates around ‘social contracts’ for adaptation, that is, an agreement on the distribution of roles and responsibilities, and inform future adaptation governance."

Here, using coupled model intercomparison project phase 5/6 (CMIP5/6) climate projections, we show a future decrease in poleward ocean heat transport (OHT) across all Northern Hemisphere latitudes and south of 10° S. Most notably, the CMIP5/6 multimodel mean reduction in poleward OHT for the Atlantic at 26.5° N and Indo-Pacific at 20° S is 0.093–0.304 PW and 0.097–0.194 PW, respectively, dependent on scenario and CMIP phase. These changes in OHT are driven by decline in overturning circulation dampened by upper ocean warming. In the Southern Ocean, the reduction in poleward OHT at 55° S is 0.071–0.268 PW. The projected changes are stronger in CMIP6, even when corrected for its larger climate sensitivity. This is especially noticable in the Atlantic Ocean for the weaker forcing scenarios (shared socioeconomic pathway SSP 1-2.6/representative concentration pathways RCP 2.6), where the decrease is 2.5 times larger at 26.5° N due to a stronger decline in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation."

With a randomized information intervention, we changed turnout expectations of a subgroup of respondents and measured the impact on the probability to join the local protest event. Our findings provide causal evidence for strategic interdependence in protest participation decisions among members of the general public rather than among a movement’s core group of supporters. These decisions are found to be strategic substitutes: individuals who expect many other people to participate are less likely to participate themselves. This dynamic has important implications for the movement’s future communication and growth perspective."

The Gulf Stream west of 68° W now has anO(10)-m-thick surface layer of warmer (by ~ 1 °C) and lighter (by ~ 0.3 kg m−3) water, contributing to increased upper ocean stratification. Our results rely on over 25,000 temperature and salinity profiles collected by autonomous profiling floats and underwater gliders in the region, allowing robust estimation of trends and clear attribution of observed changes to both ocean heat uptake and a lateral shift of the Gulf Stream."

Here we combined datasets and field sampling of fire-manipulation experiments to evaluate where and why fire changes SOC and compared our statistical model to simulations from ecosystem models. Drier ecosystems experienced larger relative changes in SOC than humid ecosystems—in some cases exceeding losses from plant biomass pools—primarily explained by high fire-driven declines in tree biomass inputs in dry ecosystems. Many ecosystem models underestimated the SOC changes in drier ecosystems. Upscaling our statistical model predicted that soils in savannah–grassland regions may have gained 0.64 PgC due to net-declines in burned area over the past approximately two decades. Consequently, ongoing declines in fire frequencies have probably created an extensive carbon sink in the soils of global drylands that may have been underestimated by ecosystem models."
Reproducibility crisis and gravitation towards a consensus in ocean acidification research,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01828-9,nature_articles/images_2023/Reproducibility crisis and gravitation towards a consensus in ocean acidification research.jpg,"To test the reproducibility of ocean acidification research, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of 373 studies on calcification of marine calcifiers across 24 years.

Here we track the reproducibility of the harmful effects of ocean acidification on calcification of shell-building organisms by conducting a meta-analysis of 373 studies across 24 years. The pioneering studies tended to report large negative effects, but as other researchers assimilated this research into understanding their biological systems, the size of negative effects declined. Such declines represent a scientific process by which discoveries are initially assimilated and their limitations are subsequently explored. We suggest that scientific novelties can polarize a discipline where researchers fail to distinguish between different motivations for testing a phenomenon, that is, its existence (theory proposal) versus its influence within ever-widening contexts (theory development). Where context dependency is high, the lack of reproducibility may not represent a crisis but a part of theory development and eventual gravitation towards a consensus position."

Furthermore, we identify soil temperature as a key factor in the soil moisture–temperature feedback. During dry and warm conditions, the energy absorbed by the soil is used to warm the soil, increasing the release of sensible heat flux and surface air temperatures. This increase in surface air temperature leads to a higher atmospheric demand for water, increasing soil evaporation, which may further dry and warm the soil highlighting the contribution of soil moisture–temperature feedback to the evolution of hot extremes in a warming climate."

We customize regional cost-effective decarbonization strategies by targeting a certain proportion of plants. We find that the more effective indicator for targeted decarbonization in developing regions is emissions intensity, while for developed countries it is age-to-capacity ratio. Whichever indicator we use to target plants, the strategy of transformation towards secondary steelmaking is generally more cost-effective than efficiency improvement in most cases, although obvious regional priorities exist. Our results emphasize the region-specific priorities of mitigation indicators and strategies in targeting plants, which help with designing short-term, cost-effective strategies for reducing steel-related CO2emissions."

Why so many long-lasting multiyear La Niña events have emerged recently and whether they will become more common remains unknown. Here we show that ten multiyear La Niña events over the past century had an accelerated trend, with eight of these occurring after 1970. The two types of multiyear La Niña events over this time period followed either a super El Niño or a central Pacific El Niño. We find that multiyear La Niña events differ from single-year La Niñas by a prominent onset rate, which is rooted in the western Pacific warming-enhanced zonal advective feedback for the central Pacific multiyear La Niña events type and thermocline feedback for the super El Niño multiyear La Niña events type. The results from large ensemble climate simulations support the observed multiyear La Niña events–western Pacific warming link. More multiyear La Niña events will exacerbate adverse socioeconomic impacts if the western Pacific continues to warm relative to the central Pacific."

We find that MHWs are typically more intense in the subsurface at 50–200 m and their duration increases up to twofold with depth, although with large spatial variability linked to different oceanographic conditions. Cumulative intensity (a thermal stress proxy) was highest in the upper 250 m, exposing subsurface biodiversity to MHW effects. This can be particularly concerning for up to 22% of the ocean, where high cumulative intensity overlapped the warm range edge of species distributions, thus being more sensitive to thermal stress. Subsurface MHWs can hence drive biodiversity patterns, with consequent effects on ecological interactions and ecosystem processes."
Widespread deoxygenation in warming rivers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01793-3,nature_articles/images_2023/Widespread deoxygenation in warming rivers.jpg,Warming waters in a changing climate have led to declining oxygen levels in oceans and lakes; the impact on rivers has been less clear.

Results revealed persistent warming in 87% and deoxygenation in 70% of the rivers. Urban rivers demonstrated the most rapid warming, whereas agricultural rivers experienced the slowest warming but fastest deoxygenation. Mean deoxygenation rates (−0.038 ± 0.026 mg l−1decade−1) were higher than those in oceans but lower than those in temperate lakes. These rates, however, may be underestimated, as training data are from grab samples collected during the day when photosynthesis peaks. Projected future rates are between 1.6 and 2.5 times higher than historical rates, indicating significant ramifications for water quality and aquatic ecosystems."

It is therefore crucial to understand the factors driving green voting and attitudes. Yet, limited research has explored the role of economic determinants in this context. In this study we show that globalization, through the distributional consequences of import competition, is an important determinant of support for parties proposing green platforms. Our analysis covers the United States and 15 countries of Western Europe, over the period 2000–2019, with trade exposure measured at the level of subnational geographic areas. We find that higher trade exposure leads to lower support for more environmentalist parties and to more sceptical attitudes about climate change. Our empirical findings are in line with the theoretical channel of deprioritization of environmental concerns, as trade-induced economic distress raises the salience of economic issues."

We applied a multimodel assessment framework, incorporating recent advances that are neglected by past studies to re-estimate SC-CH4and SC-N2O. Models of gross domestic product (GDP) level effects reveal US$2,900 per t-CH4(in 2020 US dollars) for SC-CH4and US$49,600 per t-N2O for SC-N2O for the emissions year 2020, indicating a 2-fold increase over previous estimates. Models incorporating GDP growth effects over time present a further 15–25-fold increase in estimates, dominating the uncertainty in social cost estimates. Although substantial uncertainty remains, our findings suggest greater benefits from CH4and N2O mitigation policies compared with those of previous studies."

Province-level results show that, while economic development initially drives up material demand, it also enables closed loops as demand approaches saturation levels. Between now and 2060, improved scrap recovery cumulatively reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 10%, while more intensive use, resulting in reduced material demand, reduces emissions by 21%. Lifetime extension offers a modest benefit, leading to a 3% reduction in emissions. Alongside the large potential for recycling, our findings highlight the importance of demand reduction in meeting global climate targets."

We also show that the amplitude of both natural and forced variability is not captured by the CMIP5 and six model ensemble members, which could be explained in part by the Southern Annular Mode. This shows that failing to consider the feedback loops causing polar amplification could lead to an underestimation of the magnitude of anthropogenic warming and its consequences in Antarctica."

However, intact tropical South American forests overall were no more sensitive to the extreme 2015–2016 El Niño than to previous less intense events, remaining a key defence against climate change as long as they are protected."

Here we show that the snow supply risk to ski tourism increases with global warming level, heterogeneously within and across mountain areas and countries. Without snowmaking, 53% and 98% of the 2,234 ski resorts studied in 28 European countries are projected to be at very high risk for snow supply under global warming of 2 °C and 4 °C, respectively. By contrast, assuming a snowmaking fractional coverage of 50% leads to corresponding proportions of 27% and 71%, but with increasing water and electricity demand (and related carbon footprint) of snowmaking. While it represents a modest fraction of the overall carbon footprint of ski tourism, snowmaking is an inherent part of the ski tourism industry and epitomizes some of the key challenges at the nexus between climate change adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development in the mountains, with their high social-ecological vulnerability."

A sigmoidal transition is shown to adequately fit the data. When using this revised relationship, the additional warming that arises from air pollution mitigation is delayed by two to three decades in heavily polluted locations, compared to the linear relationship. This cloud-mediated climate penalty will manifest markedly starting around 2025 in China and 2050 in India after applying the strongest air quality policy, underlining the urgency of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions."

We use climate-associated genotypes to identify population-level adaptation and model maladaptation with and without dispersal and find that contemporary populations in southwestern ranges are the most vulnerable to climate change. This vulnerability cannot be mitigated by dispersal to more suitable niches because of climate maladaptation and landscape barriers. Overall, combined multiple climate change risk estimates in coevolving species can be used to improve climate change vulnerability assessments beyond what can be learned from a single species or modelling."
Climate intervention on a high-emissions pathway could delay but not prevent West Antarctic Ice Sheet demise,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01738-w,nature_articles/images_2023/Climate intervention on a high-emissions pathway could delay but not prevent West Antarctic Ice Sheet demise.jpg,"The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is expected to collapse with warming.

Stocker",No publication date,Article,"Solar radiation modification (SRM) is increasingly discussed as a tool to reduce or avert global warming and concomitantly the risk of ice-sheet collapse, as is considered possible for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Here we analyse the impact of stratospheric aerosol injections on the centennial-to-millennial Antarctic sea-level contribution using an ice-sheet model. We find that mid-twenty-first-century large-scale SRM could delay but ultimately not prevent WAIS collapse in a high-emissions scenario. On intermediate-emissions pathways, SRM could be an effective tool to delay or even prevent an instability of WAIS if deployed by mid-century. However, SRM interventions may be associated with substantial risks, commitments and unintended side effects; therefore, emissions reductions to prevent WAIS collapse seem to be the more practical and sensible approach at the current stage."

We simulated interventions in two locations with successful field trials using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate projections and historical temperature records, integrating empirical data onwMel’s thermal sensitivity into a model ofAedes aegyptipopulation dynamics to evaluate introgression and persistence over one year. We show that in Cairns, Australia, climatic futures necessitate operational adaptations for heatwaves exceeding two weeks. In Nha Trang, Vietnam, projected heatwaves of three weeks and longer eliminatewMel under the most stringent assumptions of that symbiont’s thermal limits. We conclude that this technology is generally robust to near-term (2030s) climate change. Accelerated warming may challenge this in the 2050s and beyond."
Asymmetric influence of forest cover gain and loss on land surface temperature,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01757-7,nature_articles/images_2023/Asymmetric influence of forest cover gain and loss on land surface temperature.jpg,"Changes in tree cover can change surface temperatures in multiple ways.

Here, we show how land surface temperature responds to subgrid gross tree cover changes. We find that in many forests, the biophysical cooling induced by enhanced evapotranspiration due to tree cover gain is greater in magnitude than the warming from tree cover loss. Therefore, the goal of no biophysical warming effects from tree cover changes could be achieved by regaining a fraction of previously lost tree cover areas. This percentage differs between different forest biomes, ranging from 75% in tropical to 83% in temperate forests. Neglecting this asymmetric temperature effect of fine-scale tree cover change ignores the fact that biophysical feedbacks continue to cause surface temperature changes even under net-zero tree cover changes. Thus, it is necessary to account for gross, rather than net, tree cover changes when quantifying the biophysical effects of forests."

Here, drawing on data from 14 completed flood-related relocation cases, we use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis and find that planning decisions, alone and taken together, contributed to sustainable livelihood outcomes. Relocation processes initiated and driven by community members had better outcomes than government-driven processes, adding a global comparative perspective to prior findings. Speed and transfer dynamics were also critical, with different implications for small and large communities. As a result, multiple pathways of planning decisions can lead to better outcomes, highlighting potential entry points for policy to promote more sustainable and people-centred planned relocation."

Our findings speak to both arguments. First, we show that drought exposure is associated with decreased altruism for survey respondents generally. We further show how group identity moderates the relationship between drought and altruism. Our results suggest a decrease in altruism due to drought is much larger when the target of altruism is presented as a member of an antagonistic ethno-religious outgroup."

Assuming maximum theoretical implementation, NBS in the residential, transport and industrial sectors could reduce urban carbon emissions by up to 25%. Spatially prioritizing different types of NBS in 54 major European Union cities could reduce anthropogenic carbon emissions by on average 17.4%. Coupling NBS with other existing measures in Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios could reduce total carbon emissions by 57.3% in 2030, with both indirect pathways and sequestration.

In two sets of extreme scenario simulations, a modification of the permafrost hydrology resulted in diverging hydroclimatic trajectories that, however, led to comparable methane fluxes. While a wet Arctic showed almost twice the wetland area compared with an increasingly dry Arctic, the latter featured greater substrate availability due to higher temperatures resulting from reduced evaporation, diminished cloudiness and more surface solar radiation. Given the limitations of present-day models and the potential model dependence of the atmospheric response, our results provide merely a qualitative estimation of these effects, but they suggest that atmospheric feedbacks play an important role in shaping future Arctic methane emissions."

For a neighbouring country, diffusion increases the probability of policy adoption on average by several percentage points. Translating these empirical estimates with Monte Carlo simulations into global reductions in emissions through policy diffusion suggests that for many countries, decreases in emissions as a result of diffusion could be larger than domestic emission reductions. These results support the adoption of stringent climate policies, especially in countries in which climate change mitigation might be considered as not very important because of relatively low levels of domestic emissions."

An optimal organic scenario that supports widespread cover cropping and enhanced residue recycling will reduce global soil carbon input by 31%, and SOC can be preserved after 20 yr following conversion to organic farming. These results suggest that expanding organic farming might reduce the potential for soil carbon sequestration unless appropriate farming practices are implemented."

We find that a uniform price on emissions from both sectors keeps biofuel emissions at 12 kg CO2GJ−1. However, without land-use regulation, the EF increases substantially (64 kg CO2GJ−1over 80 years, 92 kg CO2GJ−1over 30 years). We also find that comprehensive coverage (>90%) of carbon-rich land areas worldwide is key to containing land-use emissions. Pricing emissions indirectly on the level of bioenergy consumption reduces total emissions by cutting bioenergy demand but fails to reduce the average EF. In the absence of comprehensive and timely land-use regulation, bioenergy thus may contribute less to climate change mitigation than assumed previously."

Here, we quantify temperature sensitivities of denitrification-derived potential N2O and N2production.

In contrast, theQ10values for N2O (2.1 ± 0.5) and N2(2.6 ± 0.6) were similar across soils. N2was more sensitive to temperature than N2O, suggesting that warming could promote complete denitrification. Moreover, theQ10for denitrification (2.3 ± 0.5) was comparable toQ10for aquatic sediments. This finding of universal temperature sensitivity of gaseous N losses from denitrification will facilitate modelling N losses in response to warming globally."

This depletion is thought to be driven by dynamical transport accelerated by global warming, while chemical processes have been considered to be unimportant.

VSLS sources include both natural and anthropogenic emissions. Future projections show the persistence of the currently unaccounted for contribution of VSLS to ozone loss throughout the twenty-first century in the tropical LS, the only region of the global stratosphere not projecting an ozone recovery by 2100. Our results show the need for mitigation strategies of anthropogenic VSLS emissions to preserve the present and future ozone layer in low latitudes."

We show that, as a group, these experts offer strong support for a real social discount rate of 2%, a value that is also predominantly backed by economists. We find multidisciplinary support for climate policy paths in line with the United Nations climate targets when views on discounting determinants are applied within a recent update of the DICE integrated assessment model. However, this apparent agreement hides important differences in views on how the ethics of intergenerational welfare can be better incorporated into climate policy evaluation."

An increase in shelf water salinity between 2009 and 2018, previously linked to transient climate variability, drove a partial recovery (2.2 Sv) of AABW transport.

Although stochastic processes dominated the archaeal community, their relative importance decreased over time. Furthermore, the warming-induced changes in the archaeal community and soil chemistry had significant impacts on ecosystem functioning. Our results imply that, although the detrimental effects of biodiversity loss on ecosystems could be much severer, the soil archaeal community structure would be more predictable in a warmer world."

We model the historic (1977–1995) distributions of 244 heathland and grassland plant taxa using both macro- and microclimate data and project these distributions to present day (2003–2021). Whereas macroclimate models predicted major range shifts (median 14 km shift), microclimate models predicted localized shifts, generally of less than 1 km, into favourable microclimates that more closely match observed patterns of establishment and extirpation. Thus, improving protection of refugial populations within species’ existing geographic range may, for species living in environments exposed to sunlight, be more effective than assisted translocations and overhaul of protected area networks."

This arises from synergistic effects of physiological responses of vegetation to rising CO2concentration and responses of land surface—for example, vegetation cover and soil moisture—to radiatively driven climate change. Although climate change strongly affects regional runoff changes, it plays a minor role (19–27%) in the global runoff increase, due to cancellation of positive and negative contributions from different regions. Our findings highlight the importance of accurate model representation of land surface processes for reliable projections of global runoff to support sustainable management of water resources."

We investigate the importance of this metric by comparing the number of people at risk from inundation to the number of people at risk from isolation. Considering inundated roadways during mean higher high water tides in the coastal United States shows, although highly spatially variable, that the increase across the United States varies between 30% and 90% and is several times higher in some states. We find that risk of isolation may occur decades sooner than risk of inundation. Both risk metrics provide critical information for evaluating adaptation options and giving priority to support for at-risk communities."

By providing a direct energetic pathway from small phytoplankton to fish, the rise of gelatinous filter feeders partially offsets the increase in trophic steps between primary producers and fish from declining phytoplankton biomass and increases in carnivorous zooplankton. However, future fish communities experience reduced carrying capacity from falling phytoplankton biomass and less nutritious food as environmental conditions increasingly favour gelatinous zooplankton, slightly exacerbating projected declines in small pelagic fish biomass in tropical regions by 2100."

This network reorganization shifts trophic control of food webs, leading to consumers being controlled by resources. Small grazers and cyanobacteria emerge as sensitive indicators of changes in plankton networks.

Through a comparison with rivers in non-permafrost regions, we hypothesize that the observed migration slowdown is rooted in a series of indirect effects driven by atmospheric warming, such as bank shrubification and decline in overland flow and seepage discharge along channel banks, linked in turn to permafrost thaw. As lower migration rates directly impact the residence timescales of sediment and organic matter in floodplains, these surprising results may lead to important ramifications for watershed-scale carbon budgets and climate feedbacks."

This is necessary for two reasons: to avoid projections of excessive residuals and correspondent unsustainable or unfeasible carbon-removal levels and to send clearer signals about the temporality of fossil fuel use."
Future warming from global food consumption,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01605-8,nature_articles/images_2023/Future warming from global food consumption.jpg,"Although the role of the human diet in climate change has been widely acknowledged, current practices fail to capture its realistic effect on warming.

Ivanovich, Tianyi Sun, Ilissa B. Ocko",No publication date,Analysis,"Food consumption is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and evaluating its future warming impact is crucial for guiding climate mitigation action. However, the lack of granularity in reporting food item emissions and the widespread use of oversimplified metrics such as CO2equivalents have complicated interpretation. We resolve these challenges by developing a global food consumption GHG emissions inventory separated by individual gas species and employing a reduced-complexity climate model, evaluating the associated future warming contribution and potential benefits from certain mitigation measures. We find that global food consumption alone could add nearly 1 °C to warming by 2100. Seventy five percent of this warming is driven by foods that are high sources of methane (ruminant meat, dairy and rice). However, over 55% of anticipated warming can be avoided from simultaneous improvements to production practices, the universal adoption of a healthy diet and consumer- and retail-level food waste reductions."

We determined that developmental acclimation to warmer temperatures can reduce the energetic cost of climate warming from 39% to ~16% on average by reducing the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rates. However, interspecific interactions among larvae can erode this benefit of developmental thermal acclimation by increasing the activity of adults that develop at warmer temperatures. Thus, by ignoring species interactions we risk underestimating the metabolic costs of warming by 3–16% on average."

We find that residential properties exposed to flood risk are overvalued by US$121–US$237 billion, depending on the discount rate. In general, highly overvalued properties are concentrated in counties along the coast with no flood risk disclosure laws and where there is less concern about climate change. Low-income households are at greater risk of losing home equity from price deflation, and municipalities that are heavily reliant on property taxes for revenue are vulnerable to budgetary shortfalls. The consequences of these financial risks will depend on policy choices that influence who bears the costs of climate change."

Here we constrain an integrated assessment model to the Powering Past Coal Alliance’s differentiated phase-out timelines of 2030 in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/European Union and 2050 elsewhere which, for large coal consumers, lies within the range of historical transitions. We find that limiting warming to 1.5 °C then requires CO2emissions reductions in the global North to be 50% more rapid than if this socio-political reality is ignored. This additional mitigation is focused on Europe and the United States, in transport and industry and implies more rapid decline in global oil and gas production."

The moisture carried by more frequent ARs has intensified surface downward longwave radiation and rainfall, caused stronger melting of thin, fragile ice cover and slowed the seasonal recovery of sea ice, accounting for 34% of the sea-ice cover decline in the Barents–Kara Seas and central Arctic. A series of model ensemble experiments suggests that, in addition to a uniform AR increase in response to anthropogenic warming, tropical Pacific variability also contributes to the observed Arctic AR changes."

DPE finds global PPCA participation <5% likely against a current policies backdrop and, counterintuitively, foresees that intracoalition leakage risks may severely compromise sector-specific, demand-side action. DPE further enables policies to interact endogenously, demonstrated here by the PPCA’s path-dependence to COVID-19 recovery investments."

In a scenario without climate mitigation (3 °C global warming), they can lower projected flood losses in Europe by 2100 from €44(30–61) billion to €8.1(5.5–10.7) billion per year and lower population exposed by 84% (75–90%) or achieve a risk level comparable to today. The economic investment required over 2020–2100 would provide a return of €4(3.5–6.3) for each €1 invested. The risk reduction potential of strengthening of dykes is somewhat lower, at 70% (59–83%) for a comparable annual investment. Implementing building-based flood proofing and relocation measures is less cost-effective but can reduce impacts in localized areas."

Here, using an ensemble of high-resolution climate simulations with improved EBUS representation, we show that long-term upwelling changes in EBUSs differ substantially, under a high-emission scenario, from those inferred by the wind-based upwelling index. Specifically, weakened or unchanged upwelling can coincide with intensified upwelling-favourable winds. These differences are linked to long-term changes of geostrophic flows that dominate upwelling changes in the Canary and Benguela currents and strongly offset wind-driven changes in the California and Humboldt currents. Our results highlight the controlling role of geostrophic flows in upwelling trends in EBUSs under greenhouse warming, which Bakun’s hypothesis overlooked."

Hybrid populations between a widespread generalist and several narrow range endemic species exhibited reduced vulnerability to projected climates compared to pure narrow endemics. Overlaps between introgressed and adaptive genomic regions were consistent with a signal of adaptive introgression.

Earlier spring phenology in the drought year slowed drought recovery when extreme droughts occurred in mid-growing season. Delayed spring phenology in the subsequent year slowed drought recovery for all vegetation types (with importance of spring phenology ranging from 46% to 58%). The phenology effects on drought recovery were comparable to or larger than other well-known postdrought climatic factors. These results strongly suggest that the interactions between vegetation phenology and drought must be incorporated into Earth system models to accurately quantify ecosystem resilience."

Analysis of over 6 million US patents, 1976 to 2019, shows that within climate patents, AI is referred to most often in transportation, energy and industrial production technologies. In highly cited patents, AI occurs more frequently in adaptation and transport than in other climate mitigation areas.

Here, the authors use ring-width data from shrubs to show that recent snow loss in the central Alps is unprecedented over the last 600 years.","Marco Carrer, Raffaella Dibona, Michele Brunetti",No publication date,Article,"Snow cover in high-latitude and high-altitude regions has strong effects on the Earth’s climate, environmental processes and socio-economic activities. Over the last 50 years, the Alps experienced a 5.6% reduction per decade in snow cover duration, which already affects a region where economy and culture revolve, to a large extent, around winter. Here we present evidence from 572 ring-width series extracted from a prostrate shrub (Juniperus communisL.) growing at high elevation in the Val Ventina, Italy. These ring-width records show that the duration of current snowpack cover is 36 days shorter than the long-term mean, a decline that is unprecedented over the last six centuries. These findings highlight the urgent need to develop adaptation strategies for some of the most sensitive environmental and socio-economic sectors in this region."
Multidimensional partisanship shapes climate policy support and behaviours,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01548-6,nature_articles/images_2023/Multidimensional partisanship shapes climate policy support and behaviours.jpg,"Partisan polarization plays a key role in shaping climate action in the United States. By identifying positive and negative elements within party identities, the authors expand conceptualizations of Republican-Democrat to explore how partisanship relates to policy support and behavioural intentions.","Adam P. Mayer, E. Keith Smith",No publication date,Article,"Partisanship is one of the largest and most studied social barriers to climate change mitigation in the United States. Here we expand conceptualizations of ‘left-right’ or ‘Democrat-Republican’ towards understanding partisanship as a multidimensional social identity with both negative and positive elements. Partisan support or opposition for climate action can be driven by identification with the partisan in-group (positive or ‘expressive’ partisanship), as well as perceived threats from the ‘out-group’ (negative partisanship). Using original survey data, we show that when negative and expressive partisanship is low, climate policy support is similar for Republicans and Democrats. However, differences in policy support increase when partisan identification amplifies. Yet, for climate behaviours, we find more limited partisan effects. The proposed multidimensional partisanship framework revisits the role of partisan polarization in shaping climate change action and points to alternative ways to transcend partisan barriers."
Cooperative adaptive management of the Nile River with climate and socio-economic uncertainties,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01556-6,nature_articles/images_2023/Cooperative adaptive management of the Nile River with climate and socio-economic uncertainties.jpg,"The Nile River system is faced with challenges including increasing water demands, political tensions, and future climate and socio-economic uncertainties. Cooperative adaptive management can help increase synergies, balance trade-offs and bring various benefits to riparian countries.","Mohammed Basheer, Victor Nechifor, Julien J. Harou",No publication date,Article,"The uncertainties around the hydrological and socio-economic implications of climate change pose a challenge for Nile River system management, especially with rapidly rising demands for river-system-related services and political tensions between the riparian countries. Cooperative adaptive management of the Nile can help alleviate some of these stressors and tensions. Here we present a planning framework for adaptive management of the Nile infrastructure system, combining climate projections; hydrological, river system and economy-wide simulators; and artificial intelligence multi-objective design and machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by designing a cooperative adaptive management policy for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that balances the transboundary economic and biophysical interests of Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. This shows that if the three countries compromise cooperatively and adaptively in managing the dam, the national-level economic and resilience benefits are substantial, especially under climate projections with the most extreme streamflow changes."
Teleconnections among tipping elements in the Earth system,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01558-4,nature_articles/images_2023/Teleconnections among tipping elements in the Earth system.jpg,"Teleconnections between tipping elements in the Earth system are unclear. Here the authors use a climate network approach to link the Amazon Rainforest Area and the Tibetan Plateau, and show that current snow cover loss on the Tibetan Plateau is an early warning signal for an approaching tipping point.","Teng Liu, Dean Chen, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber",No publication date,Article,"Tipping elements are components of the Earth system that may shift abruptly and irreversibly from one state to another at specific thresholds. It is not well understood to what degree tipping of one system can influence other regions or tipping elements. Here, we propose a climate network approach to analyse the global impacts of a prominent tipping element, the Amazon Rainforest Area (ARA). We find that the ARA exhibits strong correlations with regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and West Antarctic ice sheet. Models show that the identified teleconnection propagation path between the ARA and the TP is robust under climate change. In addition, we detect that TP snow cover extent has been losing stability since 2008. We further uncover that various climate extremes between the ARA and the TP are synchronized under climate change. Our framework highlights that tipping elements can be linked and also the potential predictability of cascading tipping dynamics."
Meta-analysis on necessary investment shifts to reach net zero pathways in Europe,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01549-5,nature_articles/images_2023/Meta-analysis on necessary investment shifts to reach net zero pathways in Europe.jpg,"Urgent and targeted financial investments are essential for reaching the net zero target in Europe, while a comprehensive mapping is still missing. This meta-analysis demonstrates the necessity of rapid increase in investments and displays the potential patterns across various sectors.","Lena Klaaßen, Bjarne Steffen",No publication date,Article,"Reaching a pathway towards net zero GHG emissions requires rapid and massive investments in low-carbon infrastructure. To redirect finance flows accordingly, particularly the European Union places an emphasis on sustainable finance regulation. However, the specific investment shifts required are not fully understood, which could lead to an insufficient steering effect for crucial technologies. Here we conduct a meta-analysis to derive the required technology-level investment shifts for climate-relevant infrastructure until 2035. We find a steep uptick in overall investment need, with almost €90 billion yr−1being required already within the very near term (2021–25). Investment shifts are most drastic for power plants, electricity grids and rail infrastructure, which is even increased by the ambitions to become independent from Russian gas imports. Our findings highlight the need for sustainable finance policies that take into account the financing structures of these sectors specifically."

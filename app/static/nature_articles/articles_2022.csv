Global warming overshoots increase risks of climate tipping cascades in a network model,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01545-9,nature_articles/images_2022/Global warming overshoots increase risks of climate tipping cascades in a network model.jpg,Temporarily exceeding temperature targets could increase risk of crossing tipping-element thresholds. This study considers a range of overshoot scenarios in a stylized network model and shows that overshoots increase tipping risks by up to 72% compared with remaining within targets.,"Nico Wunderling, Ricarda Winkelmann, Jonathan F. Donges",No publication date,Article,"Current policies and actions make it very likely, at least temporarily, to overshoot the Paris climate targets of 1.5–<2.0 °C above pre-industrial levels. If this global warming range is exceeded, potential tipping elements such as the Greenland Ice Sheet and Amazon rainforest may be at increasing risk of crossing critical thresholds. This raises the question of how much this risk is amplified by increasing overshoot magnitude and duration. Here we investigate the danger for tipping under a range of temperature overshoot scenarios using a stylized network model of four interacting climate tipping elements. Our model analysis reveals that temporary overshoots can increase tipping risks by up to 72% compared with non-overshoot scenarios, even when the long-term equilibrium temperature stabilizes within the Paris range. Our results suggest that avoiding high-end climate risks is possible only for low-temperature overshoots and if long-term temperatures stabilize at or below today’s levels of global warming."
Reduced CO2 uptake and growing nutrient sequestration from slowing overturning circulation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01555-7,nature_articles/images_2022/Reduced CO2 uptake and growing nutrient sequestration from slowing overturning circulation.jpg,"Ocean carbon uptake could be affected by changes in circulation. This modelling study shows that meridional overturning circulation slowdown increases deep-ocean storage via the biological pump but decreases carbon uptake via the solubility pump, with a net reduction in oceanic uptake of CO2.","Y. Liu, J. K. Moore, W. L. Wang",No publication date,Article,"Current Earth system models (ESMs) project dramatic slowing (28–42% by 2100) of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Southern Meridional Overturning Circulation (SMOC) across a range of climate scenarios, with a complete shutdown of SMOC possible by year 2300. Slowing meridional overturning circulation (MOC) differentially impacts the ocean biological and solubility carbon pumps, leaving the net impact on ocean carbon uptake uncertain. Here using a suite of ESMs, we show that slowing MOC reduces anthropogenic carbon uptake by the solubility pump but increases deep-ocean storage of carbon and nutrients by the biological pump. The net effect reduces ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2. The deep-ocean nutrient sequestration will increasingly depress global-scale, marine net primary production over time. MOC slowdown represents a positive feedback that could extend or intensify peak-warmth climate conditions on multi-century timescales."
Unprecedented droughts are expected to exacerbate urban inequalities in Southern Africa,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01546-8,nature_articles/images_2022/Unprecedented droughts are expected to exacerbate urban inequalities in Southern Africa.jpg,"The socio-political factors influencing societal responses to drought are often overlooked in risk assessments. Here, a social-environmental scenario that bridges natural and social sciences is used to analyse responses of a Southern African city to unprecedented drought.","Maria Rusca, Elisa Savelli, Gabriele Messori",No publication date,Analysis,"Climate change-related drought risks are intensifying in many urban areas, making stakes particularly high in contexts of severe vulnerability. Yet, how social power, differential agency and economic visions will shape societal responses to droughts remains poorly understood. Here, we build a social-environmental scenario of the possible impacts of an unprecedented drought in Maputo, which epitomizes a Southern African city with highly uneven development and differential vulnerability across urban areas. To build the scenario, we draw on theoretical insights from critical social sciences and take Cape Town (2015–2017) as a case-in-point of a locally unprecedented drought in Southern Africa. We show that future droughts in Southern Africa will probably polarize urban inequalities, generate localized public health crises and regress progress in water access. Climate policies must address these inequalities and develop equitable water distribution and conservation measures to ensure sustainable and inclusive adaptation to future droughts."
Nation-wide mapping of tree-level aboveground carbon stocks in Rwanda,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01544-w,nature_articles/images_2022/Nation-wide mapping of tree-level aboveground carbon stocks in Rwanda.jpg,"The authors conduct a national inventory on individual tree carbon stocks in Rwanda using aerial imagery and deep learning. Most mapped trees are located in farmlands; new methods allow partitioning to any landscape categories, effective planning and optimization of carbon sequestration and the economic benefits of trees.","Maurice Mugabowindekwe, Martin Brandt, Rasmus Fensholt",No publication date,Article,"Trees sustain livelihoods and mitigate climate change but a predominance of trees outside forests and limited resources make it difficult for many tropical countries to conduct automated nation-wide inventories. Here, we propose an approach to map the carbon stock of each individual overstory tree at the national scale of Rwanda using aerial imagery from 2008 and deep learning. We show that 72% of the mapped trees are located in farmlands and savannas and 17% in plantations, accounting for 48.6% of the national aboveground carbon stocks. Natural forests cover 11% of the total tree count and 51.4% of the national carbon stocks, with an overall carbon stock uncertainty of 16.9%. The mapping of all trees allows partitioning to any landscapes classification and is urgently needed for effective planning and monitoring of restoration activities as well as for optimization of carbon sequestration, biodiversity and economic benefits of trees."
Greater evolutionary divergence of thermal limits within marine than terrestrial species,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01534-y,nature_articles/images_2022/Greater evolutionary divergence of thermal limits within marine than terrestrial species.jpg,"The authors quantify the thermal tolerance of 305 populations from 61 taxa by meta-analysis. They reveal strong population-level differentiation in marine and intertidal taxa, but not terrestrial or freshwater taxa, and highlight the need to consider such variation in climate vulnerability predictions.","Matthew Sasaki, Jordanna M. Barley, Brian S. Cheng",No publication date,Analysis,"There is considerable uncertainty regarding which ecosystems are most vulnerable to warming. Current understanding of organismal sensitivity is largely centred on species-level assessments that do not consider variation across populations. Here we used meta-analysis to quantify upper thermal tolerance variation across 305 populations from 61 terrestrial, freshwater, marine and intertidal taxa. We found strong differentiation in heat tolerance across populations in marine and intertidal taxa but not terrestrial or freshwater taxa. This is counter to the expectation that increased connectivity in the ocean should reduce intraspecific variation. Such adaptive differentiation in the ocean suggests there may be standing genetic variation at the species level to buffer climate impacts. Assessments of vulnerability to warming should account for variation in thermal tolerance among populations (or the lack thereof) to improve predictions about climate vulnerability."
Adaptive emission reduction approach to reach any global warming target,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01537-9,nature_articles/images_2022/Adaptive emission reduction approach to reach any global warming target.jpg,"Accurately assessing emissions reductions for various greenhouse gases to stay within temperature targets is important. Here, an adaptive approach, based solely on observations and not on model projections, allows quantification of emissions reductions required to achieve any temperature target.","Jens Terhaar, Thomas L. Frölicher, Fortunat Joos",No publication date,Article,"The parties of the Paris Agreement agreed to keep global warming well below 2 °C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C. A global stocktake is instituted to assess the necessary emissions reductions every 5 years. Here we propose an adaptive approach to successively quantify global emissions reductions that allow reaching a temperature target within ±0.2 °C, solely based on regularly updated observations of past temperatures, radiative forcing and emissions statistics, and not on climate model projections. Testing this approach using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity demonstrates that defined targets can be reached following a smooth emissions pathway. Its adaptive nature makes the approach robust against inherent uncertainties in observational records, climate sensitivity, effectiveness of emissions reduction implementations and the metric to estimate CO2equivalent emissions. This approach allows developing emission trajectories for CO2, CH4, N2O and other agents that iteratively adapt to meet a chosen temperature target."
Younger trees in the upper canopy are more sensitive but also more resilient to drought,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01528-w,nature_articles/images_2022/Younger trees in the upper canopy are more sensitive but also more resilient to drought.jpg,The authors analyse the impacts of drought on tree growth for various species of various ages to assess the influences of forest demographic shift on future drought responses. The increasing proportion of young trees showing greater growth reduction to drought raises concern on future carbon storage.,"Tsun Fung Au, Justin T. Maxwell, Jonathan Lenoir",No publication date,Article,"As forest demographics are altered by the global decline of old trees and reforestation efforts, younger trees are expected to have an increasingly important influence on carbon sequestration and forest ecosystem functioning. However, the relative resilience of these younger trees to climate change stressors is poorly understood. Here we examine age-dependent drought sensitivity of over 20,000 individual trees across five continents and show that younger trees in the upper canopy layer have larger growth reductions during drought. Angiosperms show greater age differences than gymnosperms, and age-dependent sensitivity is more pronounced in humid climates compared with more arid regions. However, younger canopy-dominant trees also recover more quickly from drought. The future combination of increased drought events and an increased proportion of younger canopy-dominant trees suggests a larger adverse impact on carbon stocks in the short term, while the higher resilience of younger canopy-dominant trees could positively affect carbon stocks over time."
Reconciling disagreement on global river flood changes in a warming climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01539-7,nature_articles/images_2022/Reconciling disagreement on global river flood changes in a warming climate.jpg,"Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle, but how this translates into changes in river floods is not clear. Here, the authors show that changes in river flood discharge differ between flood types, with increases in rainfall-induced floods and decreases in snow-related floods.","Shulei Zhang, Liming Zhou, Yongjiu Dai",No publication date,Article,"An intensified hydrological cycle with global warming is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events. However, whether and to what extent the enhanced extreme precipitation translates into changes in river floods remains controversial. Here we demonstrate that previously reported unapparent or even negative responses of river flood discharge (defined as annual maximum discharge) to extreme precipitation increases are largely caused by mixing the signals of floods with different generating mechanisms. Stratifying by flood type, we show a positive response of rainstorm-induced floods to extreme precipitation increases. However, this response is almost entirely offset by concurrent decreases in snow-related floods, leading to an overall unapparent change in total global floods in both historical observations and future climate projections. Our findings highlight an increasing rainstorm-induced flood risk under warming and the importance of distinguishing flood-generating mechanisms in assessing flood changes and associated social-economic and environmental risks."
Policy sequencing towards carbon pricing among the world’s largest emitters,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01538-8,nature_articles/images_2022/Policy sequencing towards carbon pricing among the world_s largest emitters.jpg,"The adoption of some climate policies can facilitate the subsequent adoption of other policies, which is referred to as policy sequencing. Across sectors and countries, policy sequences often play an important role in the adoption and stringency of carbon pricing.","Manuel Linsenmeier, Adil Mohommad, Gregor Schwerhoff",No publication date,Brief Communication,Policy sequencing to gradually increase the stringency of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has become an influential narrative without much evidence beyond selected policies and sectors or case studies of individual countries. Here we provide international and cross-sectoral evidence on climate policy sequences for the G20 economies and 18 other large emitters. We find that policy sequences towards carbon pricing are a consistent pattern in the data.
Growing polarization around climate change on social media,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01527-x,nature_articles/images_2022/Growing polarization around climate change on social media.jpg,"Polarization and the resulting political deadlock have become key barriers to more ambitious climate action. Using Twitter data between Conferences of the Parties, this research identifies a trend of increasing polarization driven by growing right-wing activity alongside accusations of political hypocrisy.","Max Falkenberg, Alessandro Galeazzi, Andrea Baronchelli",No publication date,Article,"Climate change and political polarization are two of the twenty-first century’s critical socio-political issues. Here we investigate their intersection by studying the discussion around the United Nations Conference of the Parties on Climate Change (COP) using Twitter data from 2014 to 2021. First, we reveal a large increase in ideological polarization during COP26, following low polarization between COP20 and COP25. Second, we show that this increase is driven by growing right-wing activity, a fourfold increase since COP21 relative to pro-climate groups. Finally, we identify a broad range of ‘climate contrarian’ views during COP26, emphasizing the theme of political hypocrisy as a topic of cross-ideological appeal; contrarian views and accusations of hypocrisy have become key themes in the Twitter climate discussion since 2019. With future climate action reliant on negotiations at COP27 and beyond, our results highlight the importance of monitoring polarization and its impacts in the public climate discourse."
2021 North American heatwave amplified by climate change-driven nonlinear interactions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01520-4,nature_articles/images_2022/2021 North American heatwave amplified by climate change-driven nonlinear interactions.jpg,The North American Pacific Northwest experienced an unprecedented heatwave in summer 2021. This study shows that atmospheric circulation features and regional soil dryness both amplified the event’s severity; future warming increases the chance of an equivalent or stronger event.,"Samuel Bartusek, Kai Kornhuber, Mingfang Ting",No publication date,Article,"Heat conditions in North America in summer 2021 exceeded previous heatwaves by margins many would have considered impossible under current climate conditions. Associated severe impacts highlight the need for understanding the physical drivers of the heatwave and relations to climate change, to improve the projection and prediction of future extreme heat risks. Here, we find that slow- and fast-moving components of the atmospheric circulation interacted, along with regional soil moisture deficiency, to trigger a 5-sigma heat event. Its severity was amplified ~40% by nonlinear interactions between its drivers, probably driven in part by land–atmosphere feedbacks catalysed by long-term regional warming and soil drying. Since the 1950s, global warming has transformed the peak daily regional temperature anomaly of the event from virtually impossible to a presently estimated ~200-yearly occurrence. Its likelihood is projected to increase rapidly with further global warming, possibly becoming a 10-yearly occurrence in a climate 2 °C warmer than the pre-industrial period, which may be reached by 2050."
Large uncertainty in future warming due to aerosol forcing,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01516-0,nature_articles/images_2022/Large uncertainty in future warming due to aerosol forcing.jpg,"The degree to which aerosols influence surface temperatures is not well understood. Here, the authors argue that reducing the uncertainties in the climate response to aerosol forcing is one of the key challenges to reduce overall uncertainties of warming projections.","Duncan Watson-Parris, Christopher J. Smith",No publication date,Brief Communication,"Despite a concerted research effort and extensive observational record, uncertainty in climate sensitivity and aerosol forcing, the two largest contributions to future warming uncertainty, remains large. Here we highlight the stark disparity that different aerosol forcing can imply for future warming projections: scenarios compatible with the Paris Agreement can either easily meet the specified warming limits or risk missing them completely using plausible samples from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report assessed uncertainty ranges."
Asymmetric emergence of low-to-no snow in the midlatitudes of the American Cordillera,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01518-y,nature_articles/images_2022/Asymmetric emergence of low-to-no snow in the midlatitudes of the American Cordillera.jpg,"Future changes and regional differences in snowpacks are unclear. Here the American Cordillera mountain range, spanning the Americas, is estimated to lose snow faster in the southern midlatitudes—global warming should be limited to below 2.5 °C to prevent low-to-no-snow conditions across the range.","Alan M. Rhoades, Benjamin J. Hatchett, Andrew D. Jones",No publication date,Article,"Societies and ecosystems within and downstream of mountains rely on seasonal snowmelt to satisfy their water demands. Anthropogenic climate change has reduced mountain snowpacks worldwide, altering snowmelt magnitude and timing. Here the global warming level leading to widespread and persistent mountain snowpack decline, termed low-to-no snow, is estimated for the world’s most latitudinally contiguous mountain range, the American Cordillera. We show that a combination of dynamical, thermodynamical and hypsometric factors results in an asymmetric emergence of low-to-no-snow conditions within the midlatitudes of the American Cordillera. Low-to-no-snow emergence occurs approximately 20 years earlier in the southern hemisphere, at a third of the local warming level, and coincides with runoff efficiency declines (8% average) in both dry and wet years. The prevention of a low-to-no-snow future in either hemisphere requires the level of global warming to be held to, at most, +2.5 °C."
Ratcheting of climate pledges needed to limit peak global warming,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01508-0,nature_articles/images_2022/Ratcheting of climate pledges needed to limit peak global warming.jpg,"Many countries have submitted updated and new emissions reduction pledges in COP26, but further ratcheting of pledges is needed to reach the 1.5 °C goal. Ratcheting near-term ambition through 2030 could bring the largest climate benefits and avoid potential long-term temperature overshoot.","Gokul Iyer, Yang Ou, Haewon McJeon",No publication date,Article,"The new and updated emission reduction pledges submitted by countries ahead of the Twenty-Sixth Conference of Parties represent a meaningful strengthening of global ambition compared to the 2015 Paris pledges. Yet, limiting global warming below 1.5 °C this century will require countries to ratchet ambition for 2030 and beyond. Here, we explore a suite of emissions pathways to show that ratcheting near-term ambition through 2030 will be crucial to limiting peak temperature changes. Delaying ratcheting ambition to beyond 2030 could still deliver end-of-century temperature change of less than 1.5 °C but would result in higher temperature overshoot over many decades with the potential for adverse consequences. Ratcheting near-term ambition would also deliver benefits from enhanced non-CO2mitigation and facilitate faster transitions to net-zero emissions systems in major economies."
Favourability towards natural gas relates to funding source of university energy centres,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01521-3,nature_articles/images_2022/Favourability towards natural gas relates to funding source of university energy centres.jpg,"University-based energy centres play an important role in climate discourse but many are funded by fossil fuel businesses.

Global methane concentrations have increased at an accelerating rate since 2004, yet the role of fossil fuels and revitalized natural gas extraction and distribution in accelerating methane concentrations is poorly recognized. Here we examine the policy positioning of university-based energy centres towards natural gas, given their growing influence on climate discourse. We conducted sentiment analysis using a lexicon- and rule-based sentiment scoring tool on 1,168,194 sentences in 1,706 reports from 26 universities, some of which receive their primary funding from the natural gas industry. We found that fossil-funded centres are more favourable in their reports towards natural gas than towards renewable energy, and tweets are more favourable when they mention funders by name. Centres less dependent on fossil funding show a reversed pattern with more neutral sentiment towards gas, and favour solar and hydro power."
Snowmelt risk telecouplings for irrigated agriculture,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01509-z,nature_articles/images_2022/Snowmelt risk telecouplings for irrigated agriculture.jpg,"Agriculture dependent on snowmelt will face serious challenges under climate change, which increases risks for countries that import these crop products.

Mueller",No publication date,Article,"Climate change is altering the timing and magnitude of snowmelt, which may either directly or indirectly via global trade affect agriculture and livelihoods dependent on snowmelt. Here, we integrate subannual irrigation and snowmelt dynamics and a model of international trade to assess the global redistribution of snowmelt dependencies and risks under climate change. We estimate that 16% of snowmelt used for irrigation is for agricultural products traded globally, of which over 70% is from five countries. Globally, we observe a prodigious snowmelt dependence and risk diffusion, with particularly evident importing of products at risk in western Europe. In Germany and the UK, local fraction of surface-water-irrigated agriculture supply exposed to snowmelt risks could increase from negligible to 16% and 10%, respectively, under a 2 °C warming. Our results reveal the trade-exposure of agricultural supplies, highlighting regions and crops whose consumption may be vulnerable to changing snowmelt even if their domestic production is not."
Evapotranspiration frequently increases during droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01505-3,nature_articles/images_2022/Evapotranspiration frequently increases during droughts.jpg,The authors use a water balance approach to show that drought-driven evapotranspiration increases are widespread and depend on the magnitude of precipitation and total water shortage anomalies. Earth system models underestimate the probability of drought-driven evapotranspiration increases in drier regions.,"Meng Zhao, Geruo A, Alexandra G. Konings",No publication date,Article,"Changes in evapotranspiration (ET) affect water availability and ecosystem health. Higher evaporative demand during drought acts to increase ET, but droughts also reduce the moisture supply necessary for ET, limiting predictions of even the sign of ET anomalies. Drought-driven increases in ET (\({\rm{ET}}_{{\rm{drought}}}^ +\)) are of particular concern because they quickly deplete water resources, causing flash droughts and acute stress on ecosystems. Here, using a water balance approach, we show that\({\rm{ET}}_{{\rm{drought}}}^ +\)is globally widespread, occurring in 44.4% of drought months. The sign of ET’s drought response depends most on the magnitude of precipitation and total water storage anomalies, rather than its location. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 Earth system models underestimate the\({\rm{ET}}_{{\rm{drought}}}^ +\)probability by nearly one-half, and more so in drier regions, primarily due to missing representations of soil structure effects on soil evaporation, as well as incorrectly parameterized plant and soil traits. These processes should be prioritized to reduce model uncertainties in the water–energy–food nexus."
Seasonal increase of methane emissions linked to warming in Siberian tundra,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01512-4,nature_articles/images_2022/Seasonal increase of methane emissions linked to warming in Siberian tundra.jpg,The authors provide long-term observational evidence of an increasing trend of early summer methane emissions from a permafrost site in the Lena River Delta linked to atmospheric warming. This observed trend constitutes a major development given the thick and cold permafrost in the study area.,"Norman Rößger, Torsten Sachs, Lars Kutzbach",No publication date,Article,"While increasing methane emissions from thawing permafrost are anticipated to be a major climate feedback, no observational evidence for such an increase has previously been documented in the literature. Here we report a trend of increasing methane emissions for the early summer months of June and July at a permafrost site in the Lena River Delta, on the basis of the longest set of eddy covariance methane flux data in the Arctic. Along with a strong air temperature rise of 0.3 ± 0.1 °C yr−1in June, which corresponds to an earlier warming of 11 d, the methane emissions in June and July have increased by roughly 1.9 ± 0.7% yr−1since 2004. Although the tundra’s maximum source strength in August has not yet changed, this increase in early summer methane emissions shows that atmospheric warming has begun to considerably affect the methane flux dynamics of permafrost-affected ecosystems in the Arctic."

We find transformations in dune dynamics for many sand seas and dune fields across the Sahara, The Horn of Africa, the Southern Arabian Peninsula, South Asia, China and Australia—as well as an increased potential for sand sea expansion and reactivation of dormant dune fields—linked to climate change alterations in the Hadley circulation, extra-tropical cyclone activity and monsoon systems. These projected changes will affect planning for and management of dune encroachment on transportation infrastructure, industry and urban development in desert regions."

Using an agent-based model approach for current and future scenarios, we demonstrate that risk-based premiums will yield a positive societal benefit (US$10 billion) because they will incentivize household risk-reduction investments. Moreover, our results show that proactive investment in large-scale adaptation measures complements a transition to risk-based premiums to yield a higher overall societal benefit (US$26 billion). We suggest that transitioning the NFIP to risk-based premiums can only be secured by additional investments in large-scale flood protection infrastructure."

Gouhier, Auroop R. Ganguly",No publication date,Article,"Climate-mediated changes in thermal stress can destabilize animal populations and promote extinction risk. However, risk assessments often focus on changes in mean temperatures and thus ignore the role of temporal variability or structure. Using Earth System Model projections, we show that significant regional differences in the statistical distribution of temperature will emerge over time and give rise to shifts in the mean, variability and persistence of thermal stress. Integrating these trends into mathematical models that simulate the dynamical and cumulative effects of thermal stress on the performance of 38 globally distributed ectotherm species revealed complex regional changes in population stability over the twenty-first century, with temperate species facing higher risk. Yet despite their idiosyncratic effects on stability, projected temperatures universally increased extinction risk. Overall, these results show that the effects of climate change may be more extensive than previously predicted on the basis of the statistical relationship between biological performance and average temperature."

Phytoplankton production and resistance are affected by multiple factors and the temperature and partial pressure of carbon dioxide dominate the risks for reaching their tipping points. If the current emission scenario continues, 50% (40–61% at 90% confidence) and 41% (2–80% at 90% confidence) of tropical areas would reach the tipping points of ongoing phytoplankton production and resistance decline, respectively, in 2100. Compared with single- or few-factor studies, machine learning (for example, ensemble machine learning) provides a powerful and realistic solution for policy-makers facing large-scale ecological responses to global climate changes under multiple environmental stressors."
Unique thermal sensitivity imposes a cold-water energetic barrier for vertical migrators,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01491-6,nature_articles/images_2022/Unique thermal sensitivity imposes a cold-water energetic barrier for vertical migrators.jpg,"The authors report on the metabolic sensitivities of vertically migrating oceanic species to temperature and oxygen.

Birk",No publication date,Article,"Alterations of marine species’ ranges with climate change are often attributed to oxygen limitation in warming oceans. Here we report unique metabolic temperature sensitivities for the myriad of vertically migrating oceanic species that daily cross depth-related gradients in temperature and oxygen. In these taxa, selection favours high metabolic activity for predator–prey interactions in warm shallow water and hypoxia tolerance in the cold at depth. These diverging selective pressures result in thermal insensitivity of oxygen supply capacity and enhanced thermal sensitivity of active metabolic rate. Aerobic scope is diminished in the cold, well beyond thermodynamic influences and regardless of ambient oxygen levels, explaining the native distributions of tropical migrators and their recent range expansions following warming events. Cold waters currently constitute an energetic barrier to latitudinal range expansion in vertical migrators. As warming due to climate change approaches, and eventually surpasses, temperatures seen during past warming events, this energetic barrier will be relieved."
Warming reduces global agricultural production by decreasing cropping frequency and yields,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01492-5,nature_articles/images_2022/Warming reduces global agricultural production by decreasing cropping frequency and yields.jpg,"Climate change will impact agriculture, and this study shows cropping frequency and caloric yield are negatively impacted on the global scale by warming.

Existing studies have largely focused on crop yield, whereas how CF responds to climate change remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the global climate sensitivity of caloric yields and CF at national scale. We find a robust negative association between warming and both caloric yield and CF. By the 2050s, projected CF increases in cold regions are offset by larger decreases in warm regions, resulting in a net global CF reduction (−4.2 ± 2.5% in high emission scenario), suggesting that climate-driven decline in CF will exacerbate crop production loss and not provide climate adaptation alone. Although irrigation is effective in offsetting the projected production loss, irrigation areas have to be expanded by >5% in warm regions to fully offset climate-induced production losses by the 2050s."

Using a climate model that exploits a variable-resolution unstructured mesh in the ocean component to enhance grid resolution in eddy-rich regions, we investigate the long-term response of ocean eddy activity to anthropogenic climate change. Eddy kinetic energy is projected to shift poleward in most eddy-rich regions, to intensify in the Kuroshio Current, Brazil and Malvinas currents and Antarctic Circumpolar Current and to decrease in the Gulf Stream. Modelled changes are linked to elements of the broader climate including Atlantic meridional overturning circulation decline, intensifying Agulhas leakage and shifting Southern Hemisphere westerlies."

The aviation sector could manage the associated cost increases, with ticket prices rising by no more than 15% compared with a no-intervention baseline leading to demand suppression of less than 14%. These pathways will require discounted investments on the order of US$0.5–2.1 trillion over a 30 yr period.

This results from a poleward shift of the WBCs, associated with changes in the mid-latitude easterly winds. Consequently, the WBCs have penetrated poleward but not strengthened and are now transporting more heat into their extensions. Our study clearly elucidates the dynamic processes driving increased eddying and warming in the Southern Hemisphere WBC extensions and has implications for understanding and predicting ocean warming, marine heatwaves and the impact on the marine ecosystem in the WBC extensions under climate change."

We show that global pelagic fauna will be seriously compromised by the end of the twenty-first century if we continue under the current greenhouse emission scenario. Low and mid latitudes are expected to lose from 3% to 22% of animal biomass due to the expansion of low-productive systems, while higher latitudes would be populated by present-day temperate fauna, supporting results from ecosystem simulations. We further show that strong mitigation measures to contain global warming below 2 °C would reduce these impacts to less than half."

Earlier DFS is linked to decreased precipitation under warming and weaker drought resistance associated with various plant functional traits. For example, isohydric plants with strict regulation of water status may drop leaves fast during droughts. We derive an improved set of phenology models based on this influence and project earlier DFS by the end of the century, particularly at high latitudes (>50° N). Our results limit uncertainties in the later end of plant growth with warming, aiding estimation of carbon uptake of terrestrial ecosystems."

Under greenhouse warming, the equatorial Atlantic atmosphere becomes more stable, reducing sensitivity of the equatorial zonal winds to the zonal SST gradient; further, weakened trade winds lead to a deepened thermocline in the east, reducing SST sensitivity to thermocline anomalies. These changes feed into Bjerknes feedback to cause suppression in Atlantic Niño/Niña SST variability. These findings are in stark contrast to the Pacific and the Indian Ocean where El Niño/La Niña SST variability and strong Indian Ocean Dipole variability are projected to increase."

This expert assessment reveals that countries making the boldest pledges are also making the most credible pledges, contrasting theoretical warnings of a trade-off between ambition and credibility. We find that the quality of national political institutions is the largest explanator of the variation in credibility, and Europe’s credibility is exceptionally high. We also find that economic factors, such as the costs and benefits of controlling emissions, are statistically unimportant in explaining the credibility of national pledges to cooperate."

Winkler",No publication date,Article,"Body-size reductions are a pervasive response to climate change, and body size is a central trait linking together multiple axes of ecology, physiology and life history. Using a combination of three decades of data and controlled experiments, we show that male and female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) have become smaller structurally, despite chicks growing larger under warmer nest temperatures and larger chicks being more likely to return as adults. We find that adult structural size trends are associated with warmer overwintering conditions, rather than the nestling period. Further, adult male body mass trends depend on climate conditions during spring migration; male breeding mass decreased by 4%, whereas female mass was unchanged. This may be explained by the demands of reproduction, as lighter females produce fewer offspring. This work highlights the complex interactions that shape relationships between traits and fitness, which will be critical for predicting evolutionary responses in future environments."

The net direction and cause of these shifts, however, are not well understood. Here, we present evidence for large-scale drying across lake-rich regions of the Arctic over the past two decades (2000–2021), a trend that is correlated with increases in annual air temperature and autumn rain. Given that increasing air temperatures and autumn rain promote permafrost thaw, our results indicate that permafrost thaw is leading to widespread surface water decline, challenging models that do not predict a net decrease in lake area until the mid-twenty-first or twenty-second centuries."

The warming differential facilitates the increased frequency of extreme swings, as the ITCZ follows the maximum sea surface temperature. Our finding suggests a substantial increase in ITCZ swing-induced severe droughts/floods in the Atlantic-rim countries."

However, these effects are countered by tradeoffs between offspring size and number, suggesting that measurements of maternal fitness are critical for quantifying selection through ocean acidification. Measurements of selection and genetic variation were used to project the evolution of larval size as seawater conditions changed incrementally over many decades.

Our model suggests that phytoplankton vertical migration (PVM) fuels up to 40% (>28 tg yr−1N) of new production and directly contributes 25% of total oceanic NPP (herein estimated at 56 PgC yr−1). Confidence in these estimates is supported by good reproduction of seasonal, vertical and geographic variations in NPP. In contrast to common predictions, a sensitivity study of the PVM model indicates higher NPP under global warming when enhanced stratification reduces physical nutrient transport into the surface ocean. Our findings suggest that PVM is a key mechanism driving marine biogeochemistry and therefore requires consideration in global carbon budgets."
Poleward shift of Circumpolar Deep Water threatens the East Antarctic Ice Sheet,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01424-3,nature_articles/images_2022/Poleward shift of Circumpolar Deep Water threatens the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.jpg,"Ocean changes could affect the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and its contribution to sea level rise.

Naveira Garabato",No publication date,Article,"Future sea-level rise projections carry large uncertainties, mainly driven by the unknown response of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to climate change. During the past four decades, the contribution of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet to sea-level rise has increased. However, unlike for West Antarctica, the causes of East Antarctic ice-mass loss are largely unexplored. Here, using oceanographic observations off East Antarctica (80–160° E) we show that mid-depth Circumpolar Deep Water has warmed by 0.8–2.0 °C along the continental slope between 1930–1990 and 2010–2018. Our results indicate that this warming may be implicated in East Antarctic ice-mass loss and coastal water-mass reorganization. Further, it is associated with an interdecadal, summer-focused poleward shift of the westerlies over the Southern Ocean. Since this shift is predicted to persist into the twenty-first century, the oceanic heat supply to East Antarctica may continue to intensify, threatening the ice sheet’s future stability."
Decarbonization pathways for the residential sector in the United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01429-y,nature_articles/images_2022/Decarbonization pathways for the residential sector in the United States.jpg,"Residential sector decarbonization is an essential part of mitigation, especially in the United States where per capita energy use is high by global standards.

The lowest emission pathways involve very rapid decarbonization of electricity supply alongside extensive renovations to existing homes, including improving thermal envelopes and heat pump electrification of heating. Reducing the size and increasing the electrification of new homes provide further emission cuts and combining all strategies enables reductions of 91% between 2020 and 2050. The potential of individual mitigation strategies shows great regional variation. Reaching zero emissions will require simultaneous deployment of multiple strategies and greater reduction of embodied emissions."

Živković, S. Zaehle",No publication date,Article,"Peatlands have acted as net CO2sinks over millennia, exerting a global climate cooling effect. Rapid warming at northern latitudes, where peatlands are abundant, can disturb their CO2sink function.

We use multiannual net CO2exchange observations from 20 northern peatlands to show that warmer early summers are linked to increased net CO2uptake, while warmer late summers lead to decreased net CO2uptake. Thus, net CO2sinks of peatlands in regions experiencing early summer warming, such as central Siberia, are more likely to persist under warmer climate conditions than are those in other regions. Our results will be useful to improve the design of future warming experiments and to better interpret large-scale trends in peatland net CO2uptake over the coming few decades."

Here we identify three plausible definitions of climate-neutral aviation that include non-CO2forcing and assess their implications considering future demand uncertainty, technological innovation and CO2removal. We demonstrate that simply neutralizing aviation’s CO2emissions, if nothing is done to reduce non-CO2forcing, causes up to 0.4 °C additional warming, thus compromising the 1.5 °C target. We further show that substantial rates of CO2removal are needed to achieve climate-neutral aviation in scenarios with little mitigation, yet cleaner-flying technologies can drastically reduce them.

Our experiments generate positive effective radiative forcing in response to aerosol absorption throughout the midlatitudes and most of the tropical regions, and a strong ‘hot spot’ of negative effective radiative forcing in response to aerosol absorption over the tropical Western Pacific. Further, these diverse responses can be robustly attributed to changes in atmospheric dynamics and highlight the importance of this ‘aerosol pattern effect’ for transient forcing from regional biomass-burning aerosol."

We estimate near-future, mid-century and end-of-the-century impacts and assess the potential for connections within and across power pools to reduce changes in usable capacity and variability. We evaluate the potential synergies between hydropower, wind and solar resources in each power pool. We find that regional interconnection could mitigate some of the climate impacts on hydropower.

This shift is found in both space and time. While this is mainly related to a reduction in energy-limited regions associated with increasing incoming shortwave radiation, the largest shift towards water limitation is found in regions where incoming shortwave radiation increases are accompanied by soil moisture decreases. We therefore demonstrate a widespread regime shift in ecosystem function that is stronger than implied by individual trends in incoming shortwave radiation, soil moisture and terrestrial evaporation, with important implications for future ecosystem services."

The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) dataset is used for reconstruction because, compared with other reanalyses, it assimilates only sea-level pressure fields rather than utilize all available observations in the troposphere, making it less sensitive to temporal inhomogeneities in the observations. It can also capture TC signatures from the pre-satellite era reasonably well. The declining trends found are consistent with the twentieth century weakening of the Hadley and Walker circulations, which make conditions for TC formation less favourable."

Models simulating a larger increase in ENSO amplitude systematically produce a slower Southern Ocean warming; conversely, a smaller increase in ENSO amplitude sees a stronger warming. The asymmetry in amplitude and teleconnection between El Niño and La Niña produce cumulative surface wind anomalies over the southern high latitudes, impacting Southern Ocean heat uptake. The magnitude of inter-model ENSO variations accounts for about 50% of the uncertainty in the projected Southern Ocean warming."

Excess melt beyond the refreezing capacity of pores in snowfall has created near-impermeable ice slabs that sustain surface runoff even in cooler summers. We show that two surface mass balance models over-estimate the runoff area by 16–30%. Once restricted to our observed areas, they indicate that 5–10% of recent runoff probably comes from the expanded runoff area. Runoff from higher elevations is sensitive to projected warming as further increases in the runoff limit will increase the runoff area disproportionately."

Across crops and environmental conditions, we show that high-quality soils reduced the sensitivity of crop yield to climate variability leading to both higher mean crop yield (10.3 ± 6.7%) and higher yield stability (decreasing variability by 15.6 ± 14.4%).

Further teleconnections include weakening of the Indian and South Atlantic subtropical highs and deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low.

Here we show that current climate models severely underestimate the intensification in mid-latitude storm tracks in recent decades. Specifically, the intensification obtained from reanalyses has already reached the model-projected end-of-the-century intensification. The biased intensification is found to be linked to biases in the zonal flow. These results question the ability of climate models to accurately predict the future impacts of anthropogenic emissions in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes."

Biemans",No publication date,Article,"Irrigated agriculture in South Asia depends on meltwater, monsoon rains and groundwater. Climate change alters the hydrology and causes shifts in the timing, composition and magnitude of these sources of water supply. Simultaneously, socio-economic growth increases water demand. Here we use a high-resolution cryosphere–hydrology–crop model forced with an ensemble of climate and socio-economic projections to assess how the sources of irrigation water supply may shift during the twenty-first century. We find increases in the importance of meltwater and groundwater for irrigated agriculture. An earlier melt peak increases meltwater withdrawal at the onset of the cropping season in May and June in the Indus, whereas increasing peak irrigation water demand during July and August aggravates non-renewable groundwater pumping in the Indus and Ganges despite runoff increases. Increasing inter-annual variability in rainfall runoff increases the need for meltwater and groundwater to complement rainfall runoff during future dry years."

Shifts in both initiation and peak timing are induced by a subtle decoupling between altered phytoplankton growth and zooplankton predation, with increased zooplankton predation (top-down control) playing an important role in altered bloom peak timing over much of the global ocean. Only in limited regions is light limitation a primary control for bloom initiation changes. In the extratropics, climate-change-induced phenological shifts will exceed background natural variability by the end of the twenty-first century, which may impact energy flow in the marine food webs."

Observations since 1961 show that the occurrence of TC-induced heavy rainfall has significantly increased along coastal East Asia, while it has decreased in the southern part of WNP. On the basis of large ensemble climate simulations, we demonstrate that the observed changes cannot be explained solely by natural variability. This suggests that anthropogenic impacts have already significantly altered the TC-induced heavy rainfall pattern in the WNP region."

We first empirically confirm that the recovery rates from large perturbations can be closely approximated from internal vegetation variability across vegetation types and climate zones. On the basis of this empirical relationship, we quantify vegetation resilience continuously and globally from 1992 to 2017. Long-term vegetation resilience trends are spatially heterogeneous, with overall increasing resilience in the tropics and decreasing resilience at higher latitudes. Shorter-term trends, however, reveal a marked shift towards a global decline in vegetation resilience since the early 2000s, particularly in the equatorial rainforest belt."

Hadi Bordbar",No publication date,Article,"There is debate about slowing of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a key component of the global climate system. Some focus is on the sea surface temperature (SST) slightly cooling in parts of the subpolar North Atlantic despite widespread ocean warming. Atlantic SST is influenced by the AMOC, especially on decadal timescales and beyond. The local cooling could thus reflect AMOC slowing and diminishing heat transport, consistent with climate model responses to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Here we show from Atlantic SST the prevalence of natural AMOC variability since 1900. This is consistent with historical climate model simulations for 1900–2014 predicting on average AMOC slowing of about 1 Sv at 30° N after 1980, which is within the range of internal multidecadal variability derived from the models’ preindustrial control runs. These results highlight the importance of systematic and sustained in-situ monitoring systems that can detect and attribute with high confidence an anthropogenic AMOC signal."

This relationship is robust in constraining frequency changes in precipitation extremes in two separate ensembles and under two future emissions pathways (reducing intermodel spread by 20–40%). Moreover, this relationship is also apparent when the analysis is limited to near-global land regions. These constraints suggest that historical global precipitation extremes will occur roughly 32 ± 8% more often than at present by 2100 under a medium-emissions pathway (and 55 ± 13% more often under high emissions)."

In both observations and model simulations, Southern Ocean multidecadal variability is closely linked to internal variability in the tropics, especially in the Pacific, via atmospheric teleconnections. The linkages are, however, distinctly weaker in simulations than in observations, accompanied by a marked model–observation mismatch in global warming resulting from potential model bias in the forced response and observed tropical variability. Thus, the forced response dominates in simulations, resulting in apparent model–observation discrepancy."

Furthermore, by 2080–2100 future decline in wheat growing season snowfall (source of snowmelt) will drive a yield loss greater than the yield benefit from increasing rainfall. Explicitly considering these factors is critical to predict the climate change impacts on winter wheat production in snowy regions."

Here we show a muted AMOC response to FW forcing (~50 m sea-level rise from the final deglaciation of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets) in the early-to-middle Holocene ~11,700–6,000 years ago. Including this muted AMOC response in a transient simulation of the Holocene with an ocean–atmosphere climate model improves the agreement between simulated and proxy temperatures of the past 21,000 years. This demonstrates that the AMOC may not be as sensitive to FW fluxes and Arctic freshening as is currently projected for the end of the twenty-first century."

This is developed using data from across four depth domains, considering 12,932 vertebrate, invertebrate and algal species and three climate scenarios. The resultant climate-smart conservation areas cover 6% of the high seas and represent a low-regret option that provides a nucleus for developing a full network of high-seas marine reserves."

The ozone changes between 1955 and 2000 induced about 30% of the net simulated ocean heat content increase in the upper 2,000 m of the Southern Ocean, with around 60% attributed to tropospheric increases and 40% to stratospheric depletion. Moreover, these two warming contributions show distinct physical mechanisms: tropospheric ozone increases cause a subsurface warming in the Southern Ocean primarily via the deepening of isopycnals, while stratospheric ozone causes depletion via spiciness changes along isopycnals. Our results highlight that tropospheric ozone is more than an air pollutant and, as a greenhouse gas, has been pivotal to the Southern Ocean warming."

Strong increases in the occurrence of these events are projected with warming, but associated uncertainties remain large and poorly understood.

This occurs because local warming will be large enough that future droughts will always coincide with at least moderately hot extremes, even in a 2 °C warmer world. By contrast, precipitation trends are often weak and equivocal in sign, depending on the model, region and internal climate variability. Therefore, constraining regional precipitation trends will also constrain future compound hot–dry events. These results help to assess future frequencies of other compound extremes characterized by strongly different trends in the drivers."

We validated new crop simulation routines with field data to assess the impact of novel genotypes on Australian wheat production. We predict that these genotypes, coupled with deep sowing, can increase national wheat yields by 18–20% under historical climate (1901–2020), without increased yield variability, with benefits also projected under future warming. These benefits are likely to extend to other dryland wheat production regions globally.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest an increasing net CO2release in autumn during 2004–2018. In cooling areas, the increasing autumn CO2release is due to the larger decrease of gross primary productivity (GPP) growth than total ecosystem respiration (TER) growth suppressed by cooling. In the warming areas, TER increased more than GPP because the warming and wetting conditions are more favourable for TER growth than GPP increase. Despite the opposite temperature trends, there has been a systematic increase in ecosystem carbon release across the Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes."

Kaplan",No publication date,Article,"One of the most promising ways to rapidly remove CO2from the atmosphere is through the restoration of tropical forests. Ongoing and future climate change may, however, threaten the permanence of carbon stored through restoration. Excessive heat, drought or increased disturbances such as wildfire could all negatively impact the integrity of restored carbon. To investigate these risks to tropical forest restoration, we performed 221 simulations with a dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-LMfire) driven by a range of future climate scenarios and ecophysiological responses to CO2concentrations. We show that carbon in restored tropical forests is largely preserved under the entire range of potential future climates, regardless of assumptions we make about the potential for CO2fertilization of photosynthesis. Restoring even half of the potential area can account for 56–69% of the carbon storage, depending on whether areas are selected for low cost or high carbon gain."

Unlike temperature, the effect of precipitation remains largely elusive. Here we use carbon-flux measurements, in situ records of leaf unfolding and satellite greenness observations to examine the role of precipitation frequency (Pfreq, number of rainy days) in controlling the LOD in northern ecosystems (>30° N). Widespread decreases inPfreqduring the past three decades positively contributed to the advance in LOD, possibly due to increased exposure to radiation, exhibiting a dominant control of LOD over ~10% of the area. LowerPfreqmay also enhance chilling at night and warming at daytime, consequently leading to earlier LOD. We further develop a weighted precipitation growing-degree-day algorithm that projected a generally earlier LOD than currently predicted. These results highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of precipitation on LOD, which is necessary for improved projections."

The sensitivity of erosion to warming roughly doubles, reaching 0.4–0.8 m yr−1°C−1and 2.3–4.2 TgC yr−1°C−1by the end of the century. We develop a simplified semi-empirical model to produce twenty-first-century pan-Arctic coastal erosion rate projections. Our results will inform policymakers on coastal conservation and socioeconomic planning, and organic carbon flux projections lay out the path for future work to investigate the impact of Arctic coastal erosion on the changing Arctic Ocean, its role as a global carbon sink, and the permafrost–carbon feedback."

We find that asynchronous behaviour of mass balance between the regions has become very likely since the early 2000s, exceeding the range of previous decadal variability. Related tropospheric circulation exhibits more meridional patterns, a greater influence of meridional heat advection and a wavier summer circulation. The traceable impact on glacier mass balances emphasizes the importance of dynamic next to thermodynamic climate changes for the future of glacier mass loss, Arctic ecology and societal impacts."

This is especially true in social species where endemic diseases are widespread. Here we use 22 years of demographic data from wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) in the Kalahari, where temperatures have risen steadily, to project group persistence under interactions between weather extremes and fatal tuberculosis outbreaks caused by infection withMycobacterium suricattae. We show that higher temperature extremes increase the risk of outbreaks within groups by increasing physiological stress as well as the dispersal of males, which are important carriers of tuberculosis. Explicitly accounting for negative effects of tuberculosis outbreaks on survival and reproduction in groups more than doubles group extinction risk in 12 years under projected temperature increases. Synergistic climate–disease effects on demographic rates may therefore rapidly intensify climate-change impacts in natural populations."

Our findings show a significant and sizeable effect of temperature anomalies, heat episodes and dry spells on environmental concern and voting for Green parties. The magnitude of the climate effect differs substantially across European regions. It is stronger in regions with a cooler Continental or temperate Atlantic climate and weaker in regions with a warmer Mediterranean climate. The relationships are moderated by regional income level suggesting that climate change experiences increase public support for climate action but only under favourable economic conditions. The findings have important implications for the current efforts to promote climate action in line with the Paris Agreement."

These changes contribute to an approximately ninefold increase in agricultural area and population exposure to severe compound droughts with continued fossil-fuel dependence. ENSO is the predominant large-scale driver of compound droughts with 68% of historical events occurring during El Niño or La Niña conditions. With ENSO teleconnections remaining largely stationary in the future, a ~22% increase in frequency of ENSO events combined with projected warming drives the elevated risk of compound droughts."

The frequency of joint extreme events (exceeding both hazards’ historical 100-year levels) may increase by 7–36-fold in the southern US and 30–195-fold in the Northeast by 2100. This increase in joint hazard is induced by sea-level rise and TC climatology change; the relative contribution of TC climatology change is higher than that of sea-level rise for 96% of the coast, largely due to rainfall increases. Increasing storm intensity and decreasing translation speed are the main TC change factors that cause higher rainfall and storm tides and up to 25% increase in their dependence."

We find that winter warming may not have delayed bud dormancy release, but rather it has increased the thermal requirement in reaching leaf unfolding. This increase in thermal requirement and the decreased efficiency of spring warming for thermal accumulation partly explain the weakening response of leaf unfolding to warming. Our study stresses the need to better assess the antagonistic and heterogeneous effects of winter and spring warming on leaf phenology, which is key to projecting future vegetation–climate feedbacks."

Large marine ecosystems (LMEs) cover ~22% of the global ocean but account for 95% of global fisheries catches.

Here, using a high-resolution Earth system model and applying a ‘future threshold’ that considers MHWs as anomalous warming above the long-term mean warming of sea surface temperatures, we find that future intensity and annual days of MHWs over the majority of the LMEs remain higher than in the present-day climate. Better resolution of ocean mesoscale eddies enables simulation of more realistic MHWs than low-resolution models. These increases in MHWs under global warming pose a serious threat to LMEs, even if resident organisms could adapt fully to the long-term mean warming."

The future increase in risk will disproportionately impact Black communities, while remaining concentrated on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Furthermore, projected population change (SSP2) could cause flood risk increases that outweigh the impact of climate change fourfold. These results make clear the need for adaptation to flood and emergent climate risks in the United States, with mitigation required to prevent the acceleration of these risks."

Experimental provision of individualized information about true rebate amounts had modest impacts on public support in Switzerland but potentially deleterious effects on support in Canada, especially among Conservative voters. In both countries, we find that perceptions of climate rebates are structured less by informed assessments of economic interest than by partisan identities.

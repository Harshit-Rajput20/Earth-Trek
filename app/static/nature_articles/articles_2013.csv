Genetic diversity in caribou linked to past and future climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2074,nature_articles/images_2013/Genetic diversity in caribou linked to past and future climate change.jpg,"Caribou populations that have experienced a relatively stable climatic history have high genetic diversity and occur in regions where climate stability is expected to continue. These findings, based on analyses of molecular data, predicted species distributions and a diffusion model, provide insight into the role of past and future climate change in controlling species’ genetic structure and evolutionary potential.","Glenn Yannic, Loïc Pellissier, Steeve D. Côté",No publication date,Letter,"Climate-driven range fluctuations during the Pleistocene have continuously reshaped species distribution leading to populations of contrasting genetic diversity. Contemporary climate change is similarly influencing species distribution and population structure, with important consequences for patterns of genetic diversity and species’ evolutionary potential1. Yet few studies assess the impacts of global climatic changes on intraspecific genetic variation2,3,4,5. Here, combining analyses of molecular data with time series of predicted species distributions and a model of diffusion through time over the past 21 kyr, we unravel caribou response to past and future climate changes across its entire Holarctic distribution. We found that genetic diversity is geographically structured with two main caribou lineages, one originating from and confined to Northeastern America, the other originating from Euro-Beringia but also currently distributed in western North America. Regions that remained climatically stable over the past 21 kyr maintained a high genetic diversity and are also predicted to experience higher climatic stability under future climate change scenarios. Our interdisciplinary approach, combining genetic data and spatial analyses of climatic stability (applicable to virtually any taxon), represents a significant advance in inferring how climate shapes genetic diversity and impacts genetic structure."
Sensitivity of collective action to uncertainty about climate tipping points,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2059,nature_articles/images_2013/Sensitivity of collective action to uncertainty about climate tipping points.jpg,"Studies about early warning signals of a climate tipping point suggest that collective action to avoid a catastrophe will only take place if uncertainty about the threshold for dangerous climate change is reduced. An experiment now finds that behaviour changes dramatically either side of a dividing line for this threshold uncertainty—when uncertainty is only slightly larger, catastrophe is not averted.","Scott Barrett, Astrid Dannenberg",No publication date,Letter,"Despite more than two decades of diplomatic effort, concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to trend upwards, creating the risk that we may someday cross a threshold for ‘dangerous’ climate change1,2,3. Although climate thresholds are very uncertain, new research is trying to devise ‘early warning signals’ of an approaching tipping point4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. This research offers a tantalizing promise: whereas collective action fails when threshold uncertainty is large, reductions in this uncertainty may bring about the behavioural change needed to avert a climate ‘catastrophe’5. Here we present the results of an experiment, rooted in a game-theoretic model, showing that behaviour differs markedly either side of a dividing line for threshold uncertainty. On one side of the dividing line, where threshold uncertainty is relatively large, free riding proves irresistible and trust illusive, making it virtually inevitable that the tipping point will be crossed. On the other side, where threshold uncertainty is small, the incentive to coordinate is strong and trust more robust, often leading the players to avoid crossing the tipping point. Our results show that uncertainty must be reduced to this ‘good’ side of the dividing line to stimulate the behavioural shift needed to avoid ‘dangerous’ climate change."
Extreme summer weather in northern mid-latitudes linked to a vanishing cryosphere,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2065,nature_articles/images_2013/Extreme summer weather in northern mid-latitudes linked to a vanishing cryosphere.jpg,"The Northern Hemisphere has seen record declines in the summer sea-ice and snow cover at high latitudes, as well as a recent increase in extreme summer events at mid latitudes. The connection between these has been unclear; however, changes in atmospheric circulation attributable to the reduced cryosphere are now shown to be linked to the summer extremes.","Qiuhong Tang, Xuejun Zhang, Jennifer A. Francis",No publication date,Letter,"The past decade has seen an exceptional number of unprecedented summer extreme weather events1,2,3,4in northern mid-latitudes, along with record declines in both summer Arctic sea ice5,6and snow cover on high-latitude land7. The underlying mechanisms that link the shrinking cryosphere with summer extreme weather, however, remain unclear8,9,10,11,12. Here, we combine satellite observations of early summer snow cover and summer sea-ice extent13with atmospheric reanalysis data14to demonstrate associations between summer weather patterns in mid-latitudes and losses of snow and sea ice. Results suggest that the atmospheric circulation responds differently to changes in the ice and snow extents, with a stronger response to sea-ice loss, even though its reduction is half as large as that for the snow cover. Atmospheric changes associated with the combined snow/ice reductions reveal widespread upper-level height increases, weaker upper-level zonal winds at high latitudes, a more amplified upper-level pattern, and a general northward shift in the jet stream. More frequent extreme summer heat events over mid-latitude continents are linked with reduced sea ice and snow through these circulation changes."
El Niño–La Niña cycle and recent trends in continental evaporation,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2068,nature_articles/images_2013/El Niño_La Niña cycle and recent trends in continental evaporation.jpg,"Climate change is expected to strengthen the hydrological cycle but this is yet to be conclusively shown. Satellite observations are used to investigate changes in terrestrial evaporation, indicating increases at northern latitudes that are in line with expectations. However, global multidecadal variability is dominated by El Niño/Southern Oscillation cycles.","Diego G. Miralles, Martinus J. van den Berg, A. Johannes Dolman",No publication date,Letter,"The hydrological cycle is expected to intensify in response to global warming1,2,3. Yet, little unequivocal evidence of such an acceleration has been found on a global scale4,5,6. This holds in particular for terrestrial evaporation, the crucial return flow of water from land to atmosphere7. Here we use satellite observations to reveal that continental evaporation has increased in northern latitudes, at rates consistent with expectations derived from temperature trends. However, at the global scale, the dynamics of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have dominated the multi-decadal variability. During El Niño, limitations in terrestrial moisture supply result in vegetation water stress and reduced evaporation in eastern and central Australia, southern Africa and eastern South America. The opposite situation occurs during La Niña. Our results suggest that recent multi-year declines in global average continental evaporation8,9reflect transitions to El Niño conditions, and are not the consequence of a persistent reorganization of the terrestrial water cycle. Future changes in continental evaporation will be determined by the response of ENSO to changes in global radiative forcing, which still remains highly uncertain10,11."
Mid-latitude westerlies as a driver of glacier variability in monsoonal High Asia,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2055,nature_articles/images_2013/Mid-latitude westerlies as a driver of glacier variability in monsoonal High Asia.jpg,"The tropical monsoon is thought to play a key role in glacier change in High Asia. The mass balance of a glacier in the southern Tibetan Plateau is found to be due to May/June precipitation, which is controlled by mid-latitude climate and the tropical monsoon. Further attention should be paid to mid-latitude climate to understand glacier changes.","Thomas Mölg, Fabien Maussion, Dieter Scherer",No publication date,Article,
High Arctic wetting reduces permafrost carbon feedbacks to climate warming,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2058,nature_articles/images_2013/High Arctic wetting reduces permafrost carbon feedbacks to climate warming.jpg,"The combination of climatic warming and wetting can increase the CO2 sink strength of High Arctic semi-deserts by an order of magnitude, according to a long-term climate manipulation experiment in northwest Greenland. These findings indicate that parts of the High Arctic have the potential to remain a strong carbon sink under future global warming.","M. Lupascu, J. M. Welker, C. I. Czimczik",No publication date,Letter,"The carbon (C) balance of permafrost regions is predicted to be extremely sensitive to climatic changes1,2,3. Major uncertainties exist in the rate of permafrost thaw and associated C emissions (33–508 Pg C or 0.04–1.69 °C by 2100; refs2,3) and plant C uptake. In the High Arctic, semi-deserts retain unique soil–plant–permafrost interactions4,5and heterogeneous soil C pools6(>12 Pg C; ref.7). Owing to its coastal proximity, marked changes are expected for High Arctic tundra8. With declining summer sea-ice cover9, these systems are simultaneously exposed to rising temperatures9, increases in precipitation10and permafrost degradation11. Here we show, using measurements of tundra–atmosphere C fluxes and soil C sources (14C) at a long-term climate change experiment in northwest Greenland, that warming decreased the summer CO2sink strength of semi-deserts by up to 55%. In contrast, warming combined with wetting increased the CO2sink strength by an order of magnitude. Further, wetting while relocating recently assimilated plant C into the deep soil decreased old C loss compared with the warming-only treatment. Consequently, the High Arctic has the potential to remain a strong C sink even as the rest of the permafrost region transitions to a net C source as a result of future global warming."
Resilience and signatures of tropicalization in protected reef fish communities,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2062,nature_articles/images_2013/Resilience and signatures of tropicalization in protected reef fish communities.jpg,The marine environment is under threat from climate change. This study finds that marine reserves can maintain biodiversity and abundance of large-bodied individuals in a warming environment. They also protect against colonization by range-shifting species when compared with fished sites.,"Amanda E. Bates, Neville S. Barrett, Graham J. Edgar",No publication date,Letter,"Habitat reserves can promote ecological resilience to climate variability by supporting intact trophic webs and large-bodied individuals1,2,3. Protection may also alter community responses to long-term climate change by offering habitat for range-shifting species4. Here we analyse the species richness, diversity and functional traits of temperate reef fish communities over 20 years in a global warming hotspot and compare patterns in a marine reserve with nearby sites open to fishing. Species richness and diversity oscillated strongly on the decadal scale. Long-term warming signatures were also present as increasing functional trait richness and functional diversity, driven in part by a general increase in herbivores. Nevertheless, reserve sites were distinguished from fished sites by displaying: greater stability in some aspects of biodiversity; recovery of large-bodied temperate species; resistance to colonization by subtropical vagrants; and less pronounced increases in the community-averaged temperature affinity. We empirically demonstrate that protection from fishing has buffered fluctuations in biodiversity and provided resistance to the initial stages of tropicalization."
Continued global warming after CO2 emissions stoppage,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2060,nature_articles/images_2013/Continued global warming after CO2 emissions stoppage.jpg,"Stopping anthropogenic carbon emissions will not result in a sudden decrease in temperature. Earth system models are used to show that there may be an increase in warming after an initial decrease. This is a result of feedbacks from decreased ocean heat uptake, which exceed the cooling from decreased atmospheric CO2.","Thomas Lukas Frölicher, Michael Winton, Jorge Louis Sarmiento",No publication date,Letter,"Recent studies have suggested that global mean surface temperature would remain approximately constant on multi-century timescales after CO2emissions1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9are stopped. Here we use Earth system model simulations of such a stoppage to demonstrate that in some models, surface temperature may actually increase on multi-century timescales after an initial century-long decrease. This occurs in spite of a decline in radiative forcing that exceeds the decline in ocean heat uptake—a circumstance that would otherwise be expected to lead to a decline in global temperature. The reason is that the warming effect of decreasing ocean heat uptake together with feedback effects arising in response to the geographic structure of ocean heat uptake10,11,12overcompensates the cooling effect of decreasing atmospheric CO2on multi-century timescales. Our study also reveals that equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates based on a widely used method of regressing the Earth’s energy imbalance against surface temperature change13,14are biased. Uncertainty in the magnitude of the feedback effects associated with the magnitude and geographic distribution of ocean heat uptake therefore contributes substantially to the uncertainty in allowable carbon emissions for a given multi-century warming target."
Robust spatially aggregated projections of climate extremes,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2051,nature_articles/images_2013/Robust spatially aggregated projections of climate extremes.jpg,"There are large uncertainties associated with the projection of climate extremes. This study shows that the uncertainties are mainly due to internal climate variability. However, model projections are consistent when averaged across regions, allowing robust projection of future extremes.","E. M. Fischer, U. Beyerle, R. Knutti",No publication date,Letter,"Many climatic extremes are changing1,2,3,4,5, and decision-makers express a strong need for reliable information on further changes over the coming decades as a basis for adaptation strategies. Here, we demonstrate that for extremes stakeholders will have to deal with large irreducible uncertainties on local to regional scales as a result of internal variability, even if climate models improve rapidly. A multimember initial condition ensemble carried out with an Earth system model shows that trends towards more intense hot and less intense cold extremes may be masked or even reversed locally for the coming three to five decades even if greenhouse gas emissions rapidly increase. Likewise, despite a long-term trend towards more intense precipitation and longer dry spells, multidecadal trends of opposite sign cannot be excluded over many land points. However, extremes may dramatically change at a rate much larger than anticipated from the long-term signal. Despite these large irreducible uncertainties on the local scale, projections are remarkably consistent from an aggregated spatial probability perspective. Models agree that within only three decades about half of the land fraction will see significantly more intense hot extremes. We show that even in the short term the land fraction experiencing more intense precipitation events is larger than expected from internal variability. The proposed perspective yields valuable information for decision-makers and stakeholders at the international level."
Partial offsets in ocean acidification from changing coral reef biogeochemistry,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2050,nature_articles/images_2013/Partial offsets in ocean acidification from changing coral reef biogeochemistry.jpg,The water chemistry in reef systems can be significantly different from that of the open ocean. Now research based on observations from Bermuda shows that the responses of coral reef communities to ocean acidification could partially offset changes in seawater pH and aragonite saturation.,"Andreas J. Andersson, Kiley L. Yeakel, Samantha J. de Putron",No publication date,Letter,"Concerns have been raised about how coral reefs will be affected by ocean acidification1,2, but projections of future seawater CO2chemistry have focused solely on changes in the pH and aragonite saturation state (Ωa) of open-ocean surface seawater conditions surrounding coral reefs1,2,3,4rather than the reef systems themselves. The seawater CO2chemistry within heterogeneous reef systems can be significantly different from that of the open ocean depending on the residence time, community composition and the main biogeochemical processes occurring on the reef, that is, net ecosystem production (NEP = gross primary production − autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration) and net ecosystem calcification (NEC = gross calcification − gross CaCO3dissolution), which combined act to modify seawater chemistry5,6,7. On the basis of observations from the Bermuda coral reef, we show that a range of projected biogeochemical responses of coral reef communities to ocean acidification by the end of this century could partially offset changes in seawater pH andΩaby an average of 12–24% and 15–31%, respectively."
Hybridization may facilitate in situ survival of endemic species through periods of climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2027,nature_articles/images_2013/Hybridization may facilitate in situ survival of endemic species through periods of climate change.jpg,Predicting species’ chances of survival under climate change requires an understanding of their adaptive potential. Now research into hybridization—one mechanism that could facilitate adaptation—shows that species of the plant genus Pachycladon that survived the Last Glacial Maximum benefited from the transfer of genetic information through hybridization.,"Matthias Becker, Nicole Gruenheit, Peter J. Lockhart",No publication date,Letter,"Predicting survival and extinction scenarios for climate change requires an understanding of the present day ecological characteristics of species and future available habitats, but also the adaptive potential of species to cope with environmental change. Hybridization is one mechanism that could facilitate this. Here we report statistical evidence that the transfer of genetic information through hybridization is a feature of species from the plant genusPachycladonthat survived the Last Glacial Maximum in geographically separated alpine refugia in New Zealand’s South Island. We show that transferred glucosinolate hydrolysis genes also exhibit evidence of intra-locus recombination. Such gene exchange and recombination has the potential to alter the chemical defence in the offspring of hybridizing species. We use a mathematical model to show that when hybridization increases the adaptive potential of species, future biodiversity will be best protected by preserving closely related species that hybridize rather than by conserving distantly related species that are genetically isolated."

Water–CO2 trade-offs in electricity generation planning,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2032,nature_articles/images_2013/Water_CO2 trade-offs in electricity generation planning.jpg,The amount of water required for electricity generation is expected to increase as CO2 emissions are reduced. A capacity expansion model of the Texas electricity grid in the USA demonstrates the trade-offs between CO2 emissions and water use in designing the power generation mix. Better understanding of the ‘water–energy nexus’ should help to coordinate mitigation and adaptation planning in the energy sector.,"Mort Webster, Pearl Donohoo, Bryan Palmintier",No publication date,Letter,"In 2011, the state of Texas experienced the lowest annual rainfall on record1, with similar droughts affecting East Africa, China and Australia. Climate change is expected to further increase the likelihood and severity of future droughts2. Simultaneously, population and industrial growth increases demand for drought-stressed water resources3and energy, including electricity. In the US, nearly half of water withdrawals are for electricity generation4, much of which comes from greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuel combustion. The result is a three-way tension among efforts to meet growing energy demands while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and water withdrawals, a critical issue within the so-called water–energy nexus. We focus on this interaction within the electric sector by using a generation expansion planning model to explore the trade-offs. We show that large reductions in CO2emissions would probably increase water withdrawals for electricity generation in the absence of limits on water usage, and that simultaneous restriction of CO2emissions and water withdrawals requires a different mix of energy technologies and higher costs than one would plan to reduce either CO2or water alone."

Research into mortality from extremes of heat in Stockholm now shows that during the period 1980–2009 mortality was double that likely to have occurred without climate change. Moreover, the frequency of cold extremes also increased slightly, despite higher average winter temperatures, contributing to a small increase in mortality during the winter months.","Daniel Oudin Åström, Bertil Forsberg, Joacim Rocklöv",No publication date,Article,
Intra- and intergenerational discounting in the climate game,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2024,nature_articles/images_2013/Intra- and intergenerational discounting in the climate game.jpg,The role of temporal discounting in group decisions is poorly understood. A group experiment on collective risk in the context of climate change is used to analyse cooperative behaviour under different timeframes for the realization of the cooperation benefits. Results show that gains that are delayed significantly into the future—intergenerational discounting—markedly diminish cooperation.,"Jennifer Jacquet, Kristin Hagel, Manfred Milinski",No publication date,Letter,"The difficulty of avoiding dangerous climate change arises from a tension between group and self-interest1,2,3and is exacerbated by climate change’s intergenerational nature4. The present generation bears the costs of cooperation, whereas future generations accrue the benefits if present cooperation succeeds, or suffer if present cooperation fails. Although temporal discounting has long been known to matter in making individual choices5, the extent of temporal discounting is poorly understood in a group setting. We represent the effect of both intra- and intergenerational discounting4,6,7through a collective-risk group experiment framed around climate change. Participants could choose to cooperate or to risk losing an additional endowment with a high probability. The rewards of defection were immediate, whereas the rewards of cooperation were delayed by one day, delayed by seven weeks (intragenerational discounting), or delayed by several decades and spread over a much larger number of potential beneficiaries (intergenerational discounting). We find that intergenerational discounting leads to a marked decrease in cooperation; all groups failed to reach the collective target. Intragenerational discounting was weaker by comparison. Our results experimentally confirm that international negotiations to mitigate climate change are unlikely to succeed if individual countries’ short-term gains can arise only from defection."
Digestion in sea urchin larvae impaired under ocean acidification,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2028,nature_articles/images_2013/Digestion in sea urchin larvae impaired under ocean acidification.jpg,"Larval stages are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes. The impact of ocean acidification on the digestive processes of sea urchin larvae is shown to decrease efficiency owing to a drop in stomach pH. Despite compensatory feeding, the larval energy budget is likely to be affected.","Meike Stumpp, Marian Hu, Sam Dupont",No publication date,Letter,"Larval stages are considered as the weakest link when a species is exposed to challenging environmental changes1,2. Reduced rates of growth and development in larval stages of calcifying invertebrates in response to ocean acidification might be caused by energetic limitations3. So far no information exists on how ocean acidification affects digestive processes in marine larval stages. Here we reveal alkaline (∼pH 9.5) conditions in the stomach of sea urchin larvae. Larvae exposed to decreased seawater pH suffer from a drop in gastric pH, which directly translates into decreased digestive efficiencies and triggers compensatory feeding. These results suggest that larval digestion represents a critical process in the context of ocean acidification, which has been overlooked so far."
Co-benefits of mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions for future air quality and human health,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2009,nature_articles/images_2013/Co-benefits of mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions for future air quality and human health.jpg,"Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions often reduces co-emitted air pollutants, with advantages for human health. Avoided mortality from air pollution, a co-benefit of CO2 abatement, is estimated under global climate change mitigation scenarios to be in the range of US$50–US$380 per tonne of CO2. This exceeds the projected mitigation costs for 2030 and 2050, and is within the lower range of costs expected in 2100.","J. Jason West, Steven J. Smith, Jean-Francois Lamarque",No publication date,Letter,"Actions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions often reduce co-emitted air pollutants, bringing co-benefits for air quality and human health. Past studies1,2,3,4,5,6typically evaluated near-term and local co-benefits, neglecting the long-range transport of air pollutants7,8,9, long-term demographic changes, and the influence of climate change on air quality10,11,12. Here we simulate the co-benefits of global GHG reductions on air quality and human health using a global atmospheric model and consistent future scenarios, via two mechanisms: reducing co-emitted air pollutants, and slowing climate change and its effect on air quality. We use new relationships between chronic mortality and exposure to fine particulate matter13and ozone14, global modelling methods15and new future scenarios16. Relative to a reference scenario, global GHG mitigation avoids 0.5±0.2, 1.3±0.5 and 2.2±0.8 million premature deaths in 2030, 2050 and 2100. Global average marginal co-benefits of avoided mortality are US$50–380 per tonne of CO2, which exceed previous estimates, exceed marginal abatement costs in 2030 and 2050, and are within the low range of costs in 2100. East Asian co-benefits are 10–70 times the marginal cost in 2030. Air quality and health co-benefits, especially as they are mainly local and near-term, provide strong additional motivation for transitioning to a low-carbon future."
Challenges in quantifying Pliocene terrestrial warming revealed by data–model discord,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2008,nature_articles/images_2013/Challenges in quantifying Pliocene terrestrial warming revealed by data_model discord.jpg,"A global data set of proxy-based temperature estimates and biome reconstructions is used to assess the ability of eight climate models to simulate the warm environments of the Pliocene. Model results show a substantial cold bias in the Northern Hemisphere. Sensitivity tests identify temporal variability, the temperature difference over the proxy time range, as an important factor in model–data discrepancies, indicating that future comparisons should focus on time slices with the same orbital forcing","Ulrich Salzmann, Aisling M. Dolan, Zhongshi Zhang",No publication date,Letter,"Comparing simulations of key warm periods in Earth history with contemporaneous geological proxy data is a useful approach for evaluating the ability of climate models to simulate warm, high-CO2climates that are unprecedented in the more recent past1,2,3. Here we use a global data set of confidence-assessed, proxy-based temperature estimates and biome reconstructions to assess the ability of eight models to simulate warm terrestrial climates of the Pliocene epoch. The Late Pliocene, 3.6–2.6 million years ago, is an accessible geological interval to understand climate processes of a warmer world4. We show that model-predicted surface air temperatures reveal a substantial cold bias in the Northern Hemisphere. Particularly strong data–model mismatches in mean annual temperatures (up to 18 °C) exist in northern Russia. Our model sensitivity tests identify insufficient temporal constraints hampering the accurate configuration of model boundary conditions as an important factor impacting on data–model discrepancies. We conclude that to allow a more robust evaluation of the ability of present climate models to predict warm climates, future Pliocene data–model comparison studies should focus on orbitally defined time slices5."

We incorporate an assessment of each ecoregion’s adaptive capacity, based on spatial analysis of its natural integrity—the proportion of intact natural vegetation—to present a measure of global ecosystem vulnerability. The relationship between intactness (adaptive capacity) and stability (exposure) varies widely across ecoregions, with some of the most vulnerable, according to this measure, located in southern and southeastern Asia, western and central Europe, eastern South America and southern Australia. To ensure the applicability of these findings to conservation, we provide a matrix that highlights the potential implications of this vulnerability assessment for adaptation planning and offers a spatially explicit management guide."
The impact of temperature on marine phytoplankton resource allocation and metabolism,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1989,nature_articles/images_2013/The impact of temperature on marine phytoplankton resource allocation and metabolism.jpg,"The effect of temperature on marine phytoplankton growth strategies, metabolism and composition is studied using a range of techniques. This approach indicates that temperature plays a previously unrecognized, critical role in resource allocation and marine phytoplankton elemental ratios, with implications for biogeochemical cycling.","A. Toseland, S. J. Daines, T. Mock",No publication date,Letter,"Marine phytoplankton are responsible for∼50% of the CO2that is fixed annually worldwide, and contribute massively to other biogeochemical cycles in the oceans1. Their contribution depends significantly on the interplay between dynamic environmental conditions and the metabolic responses that underpin resource allocation and hence biogeochemical cycling in the oceans. However, these complex environment–biome interactions have not been studied on a larger scale. Here we use a set of integrative approaches that combine metatranscriptomes, biochemical data, cellular physiology and emergent phytoplankton growth strategies in a global ecosystems model, to show that temperature significantly affects eukaryotic phytoplankton metabolism with consequences for biogeochemical cycling under global warming. In particular, the rate of protein synthesis strongly increases under high temperatures even though the numbers of ribosomes and their associated rRNAs decreases. Thus, at higher temperatures, eukaryotic phytoplankton seem to require a lower density of ribosomes to produce the required amounts of cellular protein. The reduction of phosphate-rich ribosomes2in warmer oceans will tend to produce higher organismal nitrogen (N) to phosphate (P) ratios, in turn increasing demand for N with consequences for the marine carbon cycle due to shifts towards N-limitation. Our integrative approach suggests that temperature plays a previously unrecognized, critical role in resource allocation and marine phytoplankton stoichiometry, with implications for the biogeochemical cycles that they drive."

Here, we demonstrate an average poleward shift of 2.7±0.8 km yr−1since 1960, in observations of hundreds of pests and pathogens, but with significant variation in trends among taxonomic groups. Observational bias, where developed countries at high latitudes detect pests earlier than developing countries at low latitudes, would result in an apparent shift towards the Equator.

Global warming amplified by reduced sulphur fluxes as a result of ocean acidification,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1981,nature_articles/images_2013/Global warming amplified by reduced sulphur fluxes as a result of ocean acidification.jpg,"Using computer simulations, this study quantifies the potential effect of ocean acidification on marine biogenic sulphur emissions and the resulting feedback mechanisms on future climate. It emphasizes that a reduction of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions is not only necessary to limit the negative effects of ocean acidification on marine life, but also to avoid amplified climate warming due to changes in biogenic sulphur production.","Katharina D. Six, Silvia Kloster, Ernst Maier-Reimer",No publication date,Letter,"Climate change and decreasing seawater pH (ocean acidification)1have widely been considered as uncoupled consequences of the anthropogenic CO2perturbation2,3. Recently, experiments in seawater enclosures (mesocosms) showed that concentrations of dimethylsulphide (DMS), a biogenic sulphur compound, were markedly lower in a low-pH environment4. Marine DMS emissions are the largest natural source of atmospheric sulphur5and changes in their strength have the potential to alter the Earth’s radiation budget6. Here we establish observational-based relationships between pH changes and DMS concentrations to estimate changes in future DMS emissions with Earth system model7climate simulations. Global DMS emissions decrease by about 18(±3)% in 2100 compared with pre-industrial times as a result of the combined effects of ocean acidification and climate change. The reduced DMS emissions induce a significant additional radiative forcing, of which 83% is attributed to the impact of ocean acidification, tantamount to an equilibrium temperature response between 0.23 and 0.48 K. Our results indicate that ocean acidification has the potential to exacerbate anthropogenic warming through a mechanism that is not considered at present in projections of future climate change."

Estimated at approximately US$6 billion in 2005, average annual losses could increase to US$52 billion by 2050 on the basis of projected socio-economic change alone. If climate change and subsidence are also considered, current protection will need to be upgraded to avoid unacceptable losses.","Stephane Hallegatte, Colin Green, Jan Corfee-Morlot",No publication date,Letter,"Flood exposure is increasing in coastal cities1,2owing to growing populations and assets, the changing climate3, and subsidence4,5,6. Here we provide a quantification of present and future flood losses in the 136 largest coastal cities. Using a new database of urban protection and different assumptions on adaptation, we account for existing and future flood defences. Average global flood losses in 2005 are estimated to be approximately US$6 billion per year, increasing to US$52 billion by 2050 with projected socio-economic change alone. With climate change and subsidence, present protection will need to be upgraded to avoid unacceptable losses of US$1 trillion or more per year. Even if adaptation investments maintain constant flood probability, subsidence and sea-level rise will increase global flood losses to US$60–63 billion per year in 2050. To maintain present flood risk, adaptation will need to reduce flood probabilities below present values. In this case, the magnitude of losses when floods do occur would increase, often by more than 50%, making it critical to also prepare for larger disasters than we experience today. The analysis identifies the cities that seem most vulnerable to these trends, that is, where the largest increase in losses can be expected."
Observed changes in the albedo of the Arctic sea-ice zone for the period 1982–2009,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1963,nature_articles/images_2013/Observed changes in the albedo of the Arctic sea-ice zone for the period 1982_2009.jpg,"Albedo is a key component in the energy budget of the Arctic region, and a thorough understanding of it is essential for climate modelling.

The treatment of sea-ice albedo has been identified as an important source of variability in the future sea-ice mass loss forecasts in coupled climate models3. There is a clear need to establish data sets of Arctic sea-ice albedo to study the changes based on observational data and to aid future modelling efforts. Here we present an analysis of observed changes in the mean albedo of the Arctic sea-ice zone using a data set consisting of 28 years of homogenized satellite data4. Along with the albedo reduction resulting from the well-known loss of late-summer sea-ice cover5,6, we show that the mean albedo of the remaining Arctic sea-ice zone is decreasing. The change per decade in the mean August sea-ice zone albedo is −0.029±0.011. All albedo trends, except for the sea-ice zone in May, are significant with a 99% confidence interval. Variations in mean sea-ice albedo can be explained using sea-ice concentration, surface air temperature and elapsed time from onset of melt as drivers."

This yielded a meta-database of 1,735 marine biological responses for which either regional or global climate change was considered as a driver. Included were instances of marine taxa responding as expected, in a manner inconsistent with expectations, and taxa demonstrating no response. From this database, 81–83% of all observations for distribution, phenology, community composition, abundance, demography and calcification across taxa and ocean basins were consistent with the expected impacts of climate change. Of the species responding to climate change, rates of distribution shifts were, on average, consistent with those required to track ocean surface temperature changes. Conversely, we did not find a relationship between regional shifts in spring phenology and the seasonality of temperature. Rates of observed shifts in species’ distributions and phenology are comparable to, or greater, than those for terrestrial systems."
Global soil carbon projections are improved by modelling microbial processes,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1951,nature_articles/images_2013/Global soil carbon projections are improved by modelling microbial processes.jpg,Earth system models (ESMs) generally have crude representations of the responses of soil carbon responses to changing climate. Now an ESM that explicitly represents microbial soil carbon cycling mechanisms is able to simulate carbon pools that closely match observations. Projections from this model produce a much wider range of soil carbon responses to climate change over the twenty-first century than conventional ESMs.,"William R. Wieder, Gordon B. Bonan, Steven D. Allison",No publication date,Letter,"Society relies on Earth system models (ESMs) to project future climate and carbon (C) cycle feedbacks. However, the soil C response to climate change is highly uncertain in these models1,2and they omit key biogeochemical mechanisms3,4,5. Specifically, the traditional approach in ESMs lacks direct microbial control over soil C dynamics6,7,8. Thus, we tested a new model that explicitly represents microbial mechanisms of soil C cycling on the global scale. Compared with traditional models, the microbial model simulates soil C pools that more closely match contemporary observations. It also projects a much wider range of soil C responses to climate change over the twenty-first century. Global soils accumulate C if microbial growth efficiency declines with warming in the microbial model. If growth efficiency adapts to warming, the microbial model projects large soil C losses. By comparison, traditional models project modest soil C losses with global warming. Microbes also change the soil response to increased C inputs, as might occur with CO2or nutrient fertilization. In the microbial model, microbes consume these additional inputs; whereas in traditional models, additional inputs lead to C storage. Our results indicate that ESMs should simulate microbial physiology to more accurately project climate change feedbacks."

Laboratory mineralization rates at 5 °C resulted in a C loss between 9 and 75%, depending on drainage, highlighting the potential of fast mobilization of permafrost C under aerobic conditions, but also that C at near-saturated conditions may remain largely immobilized over decades. This is confirmed by a three-pool C dynamics model that projects a potential C loss between 13 and 77% for 50 years of incubation at 5 °C."

Here we use ecological niche models coupled to metapopulation simulations with source–sink dynamics6,7to directly investigate the combined effects of climate change, prey availability and management intervention on the persistence of the Iberian lynx. Our approach is unique in that it explicitly models dynamic bi-trophic species interactions in a climate change setting. We show that anticipated climate change will rapidly and severely decrease lynx abundance and probably lead to its extinction in the wild within 50 years, even with strong global efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In stark contrast, we also show that a carefully planned reintroduction programme, accounting for the effects of climate change, prey abundance and habitat connectivity, could avert extinction of the lynx this century. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, why considering prey availability, climate change and their interaction in models is important when designing policies to prevent future biodiversity loss."
Prediction of seasonal climate-induced variations in global food production,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1945,nature_articles/images_2013/Prediction of seasonal climate-induced variations in global food production.jpg,Increasing volatility in food markets and the rising incidence of climatic extremes could lead to more frequent spikes in food prices.

National governments and commercial entities are therefore paying increased attention to the cropping forecasts of important food-exporting countries as well as to their own domestic food production. Given the increased volatility of food markets and the rising incidence of climatic extremes affecting food production, food price spikes may increase in prevalence in future years2,3,4. Here we present a global assessment of the reliability of crop failure hindcasts for major crops at two lead times derived by linking ensemble seasonal climatic forecasts with statistical crop models. We found that moderate-to-marked yield loss over a substantial percentage (26–33%) of the harvested area of these crops is reliably predictable if climatic forecasts are near perfect. However, only rice and wheat production are reliably predictable at three months before the harvest using within-season hindcasts. The reliabilities of estimates varied substantially by crop—rice and wheat yields were the most predictable, followed by soybean and maize. The reasons for variation in the reliability of the estimates included the differences in crop sensitivity to the climate and the technology used by the crop-producing regions. Our findings reveal that the use of seasonal climatic forecasts to predict crop failures will be useful for monitoring global food production and will encourage the adaptation of food systems toclimatic extremes."

The number of people, poor families, elderly and total value of residential property that are most exposed to hazards can be reduced by half if existing coastal habitats remain fully intact. Coastal habitats defend the greatest number of people and total property value in Florida, New York and California. Our analyses deliver the first national map of risk reduction owing to natural habitats and indicates where conservation and restoration of reefs and vegetation have the greatest potential to protect coastal communities."

Here we investigate the emergence and impact of different types of sanctioning to deter non-cooperative behaviour in climate agreements. We show that a bottom-up approach, in which parties create local institutions that punish free-riders, promotes the emergence of widespread cooperation, mostly when risk perception is low, as it is at present3,7. On the contrary, global institutions provide, at best, marginal improvements regarding overall cooperation. Our results clearly suggest that a polycentric approach involving multiple institutions is more effective than that associated with a single, global one, indicating that such a bottom-up, self-organization approach, set up at a local scale, provides a better ground on which to attempt a solution for such a complex and global dilemma."

Wolkovich, S. Joseph Wright",No publication date,Letter,"Tropical forests are incredibly dynamic, showing rapid and longer-term changes in growth, mortality and net primary productivity1,2,3. Tropical species may be highly sensitive to temperature increases associated with climate change because of their narrow thermal tolerances. However, at the ecosystem scale the competing effects of temperature, light and precipitation on tropical forest productivity have been difficult to assess. Here we quantify cloudiness over the past several decades to investigate how clouds, together with temperature and precipitation, affect flower production in two contrasting tropical forests. Our results show that temperature, rather than clouds, is critically important to tropical forest flower production. Warmer temperatures increased flower production over seasonal, interannual and longer timescales, contrary to recent evidence that some tropical forests are already near their temperature threshold4,5. Clouds were primarily important seasonally, and limited production in a seasonally dry forest but enhanced production in an ever-wet forest. A long-term increase in flower production at the seasonally dry forest is not driven by clouds and instead may be tied to increasing temperatures. These relationships show that tropical forest productivity, which is not widely thought to be controlled by temperature, is indeed sensitive to small temperature changes (1–4°C) across multiple timescales."

However, little is known about the sensitivity of krill to ocean acidification. Juvenile and adult krill are already exposed to variable seawater carbonate chemistry because they occupy a range of habitats and migrate both vertically and horizontally on a daily and seasonal basis5. Moreover, krill eggs sink from the surface to hatch at 700–1,000 m (ref.6), where the carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) in sea water is already greater than it is in the atmosphere7. Krill eggs sink passively and so cannot avoid these conditions. Here we describe the sensitivity of krill egg hatch rates to increased CO2, and present a circumpolar risk map of krill hatching success under projectedpCO2levels. We find that important krill habitats of the Weddell Sea and the Haakon VII Sea to the east are likely to become high-risk areas for krill recruitment within a century. Furthermore, unless CO2emissions are mitigated, the Southern Ocean krill population could collapse by 2300 with dire consequences for the entire ecosystem."

Observed land precipitation2,3,4and global river discharges5do not show an increasing trend as might be expected in a warming world6,7,8,9,10,11. Here we show that this apparent discrepancy can be resolved when the effects of tropospheric aerosols are considered. Analysing state-of-the-art climate model simulations, we find for the first time that there was a detectable weakening of the hydrological cycle between the 1950s and the 1980s, attributable to increased anthropogenic aerosols, after which the hydrological cycle recovered as a result of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. The net result of these two counter-acting effects is an insignificant trend in the global hydrological cycle, but the individual influence of each is substantial.

Here we present a seven-century-long ENSO reconstruction based on 2,222 tree-ring chronologies from both the tropics and mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. The inclusion of tropical records enables us to achieve unprecedented accuracy, as attested by high correlations with equatorial Pacific corals7,8and coherent modulation of global teleconnections that are consistent with an independent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction9. Our data indicate that ENSO activity in the late twentieth century was anomalously high over the past seven centuries, suggestive of a response to continuing global warming. Climate models disagree on the ENSO response to global warming3,4, suggesting that many models underestimate the sensitivity to radiative perturbations. Illustrating the radiative effect, our reconstruction reveals a robust ENSO response to large tropical eruptions, with anomalous cooling in the east-central tropical Pacific in the year of eruption, followed by anomalous warming one year after. Our observations provide crucial constraints for improving climate models and their future projections."

The social cost of CO2measures the net present value of the extra damage caused by the emission of one more tonne of CO2today. The results show that in a world with sustained lower economic growth the mean social cost of CO2increases because the climate impacts occur in a relatively poor world, suggesting that, if anything, mitigating climate change should be a higher priority for policymakers in a low-growth world."

Here we present the largest standardized model intercomparison for climate change impacts so far. We found that individual crop models are able to simulate measured wheat grain yields accurately under a range of environments, particularly if the input information is sufficient. However, simulated climate change impacts vary across models owing to differences in model structures and parameter values. A greater proportion of the uncertainty in climate change impact projections was due to variations among crop models than to variations among downscaled general circulation models. Uncertainties in simulated impacts increased with CO2concentrations and associated warming. These impact uncertainties can be reduced by improving temperature and CO2relationships in models and better quantified through use of multi-model ensembles. Less uncertainty in describing how climate change may affect agricultural productivity will aid adaptation strategy development andpolicymaking."

The evidence for phenological uncoupling is scant because relevant data sets are lacking7or not available at a relevant spatial scale8. Here, we present evidence of a climate-associated shortening of the flowering season and a concomitant decline in flower visitor abundance based on a long-term, spatially replicated (1996–2009) data set from high-Arctic Greenland. A unique feature of the data set is the spatial and temporal overlap of independent observations of plant and insect phenology. The shortening of the flowering season arose through spatial variation in phenological responses to warming. The shorter flowering seasons may have played a role in the observed decline in flower visitor abundance.

Using satellite data, we show that higher climatic variability is associated with reduced tree cover in the wet tropics globally. In contrast, interannual variability in rainfall can have neutral or even positive effects on tree cover in the dry tropics. In South America, tree cover in dry lands is higher in areas with high year-to-year variability in rainfall. This is consistent with evidence from case studies suggesting that in these areas rare wet episodes are essential for opening windows of opportunity where massive tree recruitment can overwhelm disturbance effects, allowing the establishment of extensive woodlands. In Australia, wet extremes have similar effects, but the net effect of rainfall variability is overwhelmed by negative effects of extreme dry years. In Africa, effects of rainfall variability are neutral for dry lands. It is most likely that differences in herbivore communities and fire regimes contribute to regulating tree expansion during wet extremes. Our results illustrate that increasing climatic variability may affect ecosystem services in contrasting, and sometimes surprising, ways. Expansion of dry tropical tree cover during extreme wet events may decrease grassland productivity but enhance carbon sequestration, soil nutrient retention and biodiversity3."

Historical measurements of carbon dioxide concentrations4have been used along with global temperature observations5to help reduce this uncertainty. This results in an increased probability of exceeding a 2 °C global–mean temperature increase by 2100 while reducing the probability of surpassing a 6 °C threshold for non-mitigation scenarios such as the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A1B and A1FI scenarios6, as compared with projections from the Fourth Assessment Report7of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Climate sensitivity, the response of the carbon cycle and aerosol effects remain highly uncertain but historical observations of temperature and carbon dioxide imply a trade–off between them so that temperature projections are more certain than they would be considering each factor in isolation. As well as pointing out the promise from the formal use of observational constraints in climate projection, this also highlights the need for an holistic view of uncertainty."
Woody plant encroachment facilitated by increased precipitation intensity,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1904,nature_articles/images_2013/Woody plant encroachment facilitated by increased precipitation intensity.jpg,"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of precipitation in many regions. Experiments show that small increases in precipitation intensity, but not total amount, can lead to deeper penetration of water into the soil, leading to greater woody plant growth at the cost of grasses in a savannah system.","Andrew Kulmatiski, Karen H. Beard",No publication date,Letter,"Global circulation models and empirical evidence suggest that precipitation events are likely to become more extreme across much of the globe1,2. As most plant roots are in shallow soils3,4,5, small but pervasive changes in precipitation intensity could be expected to cause large-scale shifts in plant growth, yet experimental tests of the effects of precipitation intensity are lacking6,7,8,9. Here we show that, without changing the total amount of precipitation, small experimental increases in precipitation intensity can push soil water deeper into the soil, increase aboveground woody plant growth and decrease aboveground grass growth in a savannah system. These responses seemed to reflect the ability of woody plants to increase their rooting depths and competitively suppress grass growth. In many parts of the world, woody plant abundance has multiplied in the past 50–100 years, causing changes in fire, forage value, biodiversity and carbon cycling10. Factors such as fire, grazing and atmospheric CO2concentrations have become dominant explanations for this woody encroachment and semi-arid structure in general10,11,12. Our results suggest that niche partitioning is also an important factor in tree–grass coexistence and that the woody plant encroachment observed over the past century may continue in the future should precipitation intensity increase."
Changes in rainfall seasonality in the tropics,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1907,nature_articles/images_2013/Changes in rainfall seasonality in the tropics.jpg,"Climate change is altering the seasonal distribution, interannual variability and overall magnitude of precipitation.

Nevertheless, a comprehensive framework to understand the complex seasonal rainfall regimes across multiple timescales is still lacking. Here, we formulate a global measure of seasonality, which captures the effects of both magnitude and concentration of the rainy season, and use it to identify regions across the tropics with highly seasonal rainfall regimes. By further decomposing rainfall seasonality into its magnitude, timing and duration components, we find increases in the interannual variability of seasonality over many parts of the dry tropics, implying increasing uncertainty in the intensity, arrival and duration of seasonal rainfall over the past century. We show that such increases in rainfall variability were accompanied by shifts in its seasonal magnitude, timing and duration, thus underscoring the importance of analysing seasonal rainfall regimes in a context that is most relevant to local ecological and social processes."

These warming trends will probably result in more frequent, intense and persistent periods of hot temperatures in summer, and generally higher temperatures in winter. Daily death counts in cities increase markedly when temperatures reach levels that are very high relative to what is normal in a given location2,3,4. Relatively cold temperatures also seem to carry risk2,4. Rising temperatures may result in more heat-related mortality but may also reduce cold-related mortality, and the net impact on annual mortality remains uncertain. Here we use 16 downscaled global climate models and two emissions scenarios to estimate present and future seasonal patterns in temperature-related mortality in Manhattan, New York. All 32 projections yielded warm-season increases and cold-season decreases in temperature-related mortality, with positive net annual temperature-related deaths in all cases. Monthly analyses showed that the largest percentage increases may occur in May and September. These results suggest that, over a range of models and scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions, increases in heat-related mortality could outweigh reductions in cold-related mortality, with shifting seasonal patterns."

Our global analysis of future climatic range change of common and widespread species shows that without mitigation, 57±6% of plants and 34±7% of animals are likely to lose ≥50% of their present climatic range by the 2080s. With mitigation, however, losses are reduced by 60% if emissions peak in 2016 or 40% if emissions peak in 2030. Thus, our analyses indicate that without mitigation, large range contractions can be expected even amongst common and widespread species, amounting to a substantial global reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services by the end of this century. Prompt and stringent mitigation, on the other hand, could substantially reduce range losses and buy up to four decades for climate change adaptation."

This study investigates the effects of such phenomena on US grain transportation movements both in volumes and modes. Specifically we examine the effects of possible shifts in: crop production patterns; Great Lakes water levels; winter navigation possibilities; and foreign grain production. We find that crop mix shifts reduce the importance of Lower Mississippi River ports, but increase the role of Pacific Northwest ports, Great Lakes ports and Atlantic ports. We also find a shift from barge to rail and truck transport. Conversely, a longer navigation season or a reduction in Great Lake water levels increases grain shipments to the ports in the Lower Mississippi River. Higher use of Great Lakes ports occurs under a reduction of grain production in European exporting countries that compete with Great Lakes ports."

A suite of future warming experiments (2075–2099), using a state-of-the-art high-resolution global climate model1,2,3, robustly predicts an increase in tropical cyclone frequency of occurrence around the Hawaiian Islands. A physically based empirical model analysis3,4reveals that the substantial increase in the likelihood of tropical cyclone frequency is primarily associated with a northwestward shifting of the tropical cyclone track in the open ocean southeast of the islands. Moreover, significant and robust changes in large-scale environmental conditions strengthenin situtropical cyclone activity in the subtropical central Pacific. These results highlight possible future increases in storm-related socio-economic and ecosystem damage for the Hawaiian Islands."
Springtime atmospheric energy transport and the control of Arctic summer sea-ice extent,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1884,nature_articles/images_2013/Springtime atmospheric energy transport and the control of Arctic summer sea-ice extent.jpg,"The causes of interannual variability in Arctic sea-ice extent are not well understood. This study looks at the impact of the greenhouse effect, associated with clouds and water vapour, on sea-ice formation and melt. Enhancement of the greenhouse effect, due to increased cloudiness and humidity, results in increased ice melt.","Marie-Luise Kapsch, Rune Grand Graversen, Michael Tjernström",No publication date,Letter,"The summer sea-ice extent in the Arctic has decreased in recent decades, a feature that has become one of the most distinct signals of the continuing climate change1,2,3,4. However, the inter-annual variability is large—the ice extent by the end of the summer varies by several million square kilometres from year to year5. The underlying processes driving this year-to-year variability are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the greenhouse effect associated with clouds and water vapour in spring is crucial for the development of the sea ice during the subsequent months. In years where the end-of-summer sea-ice extent is well below normal, a significantly enhanced transport of humid air is evident during spring into the region where the ice retreat is encountered. This enhanced transport of humid air leads to an anomalous convergence of humidity, and to an increase of the cloudiness. The increase of the cloudiness and humidity results in an enhancement of the greenhouse effect. As a result, downward long-wave radiation at the surface is larger than usual in spring, which enhances the ice melt. In addition, the increase of clouds causes an increase of the reflection of incoming solar radiation. This leads to the counter-intuitive effect: for years with little sea ice in September, the downwelling short-wave radiation at the surface is smaller than usual. That is, the downwelling short-wave radiation is not responsible for the initiation of the ice anomaly but acts as an amplifying feedback once the melt is started."

The process-based method relies on coupled atmosphere–ocean models to estimate the effects of thermal expansion and on sea-level models combined with certain empirical relationships to determine the influence of land–ice mass changes1,2. The semi-empirical method uses various physically motivated relationships between temperature and sea level, with parameters determined from the data, to project total sea level3,4,5,6,7. However, semi-empirical projections far exceed process-based projections. Here, we test the robustness of semi-empirical projections to the underlying assumptions about the inertial and equilibrium responses of sea level to temperature forcing and the impacts of groundwater depletion and dam retention during the twentieth century. Our results show that these projections are sensitive to the dynamics considered and the terrestrial-water corrections applied. For B1, which is a moderate climate-change scenario1, the lowest semi-empirical projection of sea-level rise over the twenty-first century equals 62±14 cm. The average value is substantially smaller than previously published semi-empirical projections and is therefore closer to the corresponding process-based values. The standard deviation is larger than the uncertainties of process-based estimates."

In this study, pace refers to the rate at which climate zones change as a function of amount of global warming. Here we show that present climate projections suggest that the pace of shifting climate zones increases approximately linearly with increasing global temperature. Using the RCP8.5 emissions pathway, the pace nearly doubles by the end of this century and about 20% of all land area undergoes a change in its original climate. This implies that species will have increasingly less time to adapt to Köppen zone changes in the future, which is expected to increase the risk of extinction5."

The temperature projections under various SLCP scenarios simulated by an energy-balance climate model1are integrated with a semi-empirical SLR model3, derived from past trends in temperatures and SLR, to simulate future trends in SLR. A coupled ocean–atmosphere climate model4is also used to estimate SLR trends due to just the ocean thermal expansion. Our results show that SLCP mitigation can have significant effects on SLR. It can decrease the SLR rate by 24–50% and reduce the cumulative SLR by 22–42% by 2100. If the SLCP mitigation is delayed by 25 years, the warming from pre-industrial temperature exceeds 2 °C by 2050 and the impact of mitigation actions on SLR is reduced by about a third."

Here, we apply a process-based model to reproduce the historical atmospheric N2O and CH4budgets within their uncertainties and apply future scenarios for climate, land-use change and reactive nitrogen (Nr) inputs to investigate future GHG emissions and their feedbacks with climate in a consistent and comprehensive framework1. Results suggest that in a business-as-usual scenario, terrestrial N2O and CH4emissions increase by 80 and 45%, respectively, and the land becomes a net source of C byAD2100. N2O and CH4feedbacks imply an additional warming of 0.4–0.5 °C byAD2300; on top of 0.8–1.0 °C caused by terrestrial carbon cycle and Albedo feedbacks. The land biosphere represents an increasingly positive feedback to anthropogenic climate change and amplifies equilibrium climate sensitivity by 22–27%. Strong mitigation limits the increase of terrestrial GHG emissions and prevents the land biosphere from acting as an increasingly strong amplifier to anthropogenic climate change."

Clear-air turbulence is linked to atmospheric jet streams6,7, which are projected to be strengthened by anthropogenic climate change8. However, the response of clear-air turbulence to projected climate change has not previously been studied. Here we show using climate model simulations that clear-air turbulence changes significantly within the transatlantic flight corridor when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is doubled. At cruise altitudes within 50–75° N and 10–60° W in winter, most clear-air turbulence measures show a 10–40% increase in the median strength of turbulence and a 40–170% increase in the frequency of occurrence of moderate-or-greater turbulence.

Contributions have also been suggested from the deep prolonged solar minimum4, the stratospheric water vapour5, the stratospheric6and tropospheric aerosols7. However, a robust attribution of this warming slowdown has not been achievable up to now. Here we show successful retrospective predictions of this warming slowdown up to 5 years ahead, the analysis of which allows us to attribute the onset of this slowdown to an increase in ocean heat uptake. Sensitivity experiments accounting only for the external radiative forcings do not reproduce the slowdown. The top-of-atmosphere net energy input remained in the [0.5–1] W m−2interval during the past decade, which is successfully captured by our predictions. Most of this excess energy was absorbed in the top 700 m of the ocean at the onset of the warming pause, 65% of it in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Our results hence point at the key role of the ocean heat uptake in the recent warming slowdown. The ability to predict retrospectively this slowdown not only strengthens our confidence in the robustness of our climate models, but also enhances the socio-economic relevance of operational decadal climate predictions."

Here we show, using climate scenarios for the 2050s and models that utilize statistical associations between vegetation and climate, the potential for extremely widespread redistribution of vegetation across the Arctic. We predict that at least half of vegetated areas will shift to a different physiognomic class, and woody cover will increase by as much as 52%.

Without abrupt, sustained, changes in ice discharge (collapse), we project a 95th percentile mass loss equivalent to∼13 cm SLR by 2100, lower than previous upper-bound projections. Substantially higher mass loss requires regional collapse, invoking dynamics that are likely to be inconsistent with the underlying assumptions of SEMs. In this probabilistic framework, the pronounced sensitivity of upper-bound SLR projections to the poorly known likelihood of collapse is lessened with constraints on the persistence and magnitude of subsequent discharge. More realistic, fully probabilistic, estimates of the ice-sheet contribution to SLR may thus be obtained by assimilating additional observations and numerical models11,13."

The observed diminishment ofSTandSVis equivalent to 4° and 7° (5° and 6°) latitudinal shift equatorward during the past 30 years in the Arctic (boreal) region. Analysis of simulations from 17 state-of-the-art climate models4indicates an additionalSTdiminishment equivalent to a 20° equatorward shift could occur this century. HowSVwill change in response to such large projectedSTdeclines and the impact this will have on ecosystem services5are not well understood.

Recent multidecadal strengthening of the Walker circulation across the tropical Pacific,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1840,nature_articles/images_2013/Recent multidecadal strengthening of the Walker circulation across the tropical Pacific.jpg,"The Walker circulation is a large overturning cell that spans the tropical Pacific Ocean.

L’Heureux, Sukyoung Lee, Bradfield Lyon",No publication date,Letter,"The Pacific Walker circulation is a large overturning cell that spans the tropical Pacific Ocean, characterized by rising motion (lower sea-level pressure) over Indonesia and sinking motion (higher sea level-pressure) over the eastern Pacific1,2. Fluctuations in the Walker circulation reflect changes in the location and strength of tropical heating, so related circulation anomalies have global impacts3,4. On interannual timescales, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation accounts for much of the variability in the Walker circulation, but there is considerable interest in longer-term trends and their drivers, including anthropogenic climate change5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Here, we examine sea-level pressure trends in ten different data sets drawn from reanalysis, reconstructions andin situmeasurements for 1900–2011. We show that periods with fewerin situmeasurements result in lower signal-to-noise ratios, making assessments of sea-level pressure trends largely unsuitable before about the 1950s. Multidecadal trends evaluated since 1950 reveal statistically significant, negative values over the Indonesian region, with weaker, positive trends over the eastern Pacific. The overall trend towards a stronger, La Niña-like Walker circulation is nearly concurrent with the observed increase in global average temperatures, thereby justifying closer scrutiny of how the Pacific climate system has changed in the historical record."

Their function depends on biological, chemical and environmental factors, both at the time of creation and throughout the life of the material. Shifts in the chemistry of the oceans driven by anthropogenic CO2(termed ocean acidification) have profound implications for the function of critical materials formed under these altered conditions. Most ocean acidification studies have focused on one biomaterial (secreted calcium carbonate), frequently using a single assay (net rate of calcification) to quantify whether reductions in environmental pH alter how organisms create biomaterials1. Here, we examine biological structures critical for the success of ecologically and economically important bivalve molluscs. One non-calcified material, the proteinaceous byssal threads that anchor mytilid mussels to hard substrates, exhibited reduced mechanical performance when secreted under elevatedpCO2conditions, whereas shell and tissue growth were unaffected. Threads made under highpCO2(>1,200 μatm) were weaker and less extensible owing to compromised attachment to the substratum. According to a mathematical model, this reduced byssal fibre performance, decreasing individual tenacity by 40%. In the face of ocean acidification, weakened attachment presents a potential challenge for suspension-culture mussel farms and for intertidal communities anchored by mussel beds."
Attribution of historical ozone forcing to anthropogenic emissions,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1835,nature_articles/images_2013/Attribution of historical ozone forcing to anthropogenic emissions.jpg,"Current thinking on the causes of anthropogenic radiative forcing in the lower atmosphere is misleading.

Using the interactive composition–climate model GISS-E2-R we find that this assumption is not justified.

On the basis of our results, further simulations with the NCAR-CAM3.5 model2, and published studies3,4, we estimate industrial era (1850–2005) whole-atmosphere ozone forcing of∼0.5 W m−2due to anthropogenic tropospheric precursors and about −0.2 W m−2due to halocarbons. The net troposphere plus stratosphere forcing is similar to the net halocarbon plus precursor ozone forcing, but the latter provides a more useful perspective. The halocarbon-induced ozone forcing is roughly two-thirds the magnitude of the halocarbon direct forcing but opposite in sign, yielding a net forcing of only∼0.1 W m−2. Thus, the net effect of halocarbons has been smaller, and the effect of tropospheric ozone precursors has been greater, than generally recognized."

Lobell, Graeme L. Hammer, Wolfram Schlenker",No publication date,Letter,"Statistical studies of rainfed maize yields in the United States1and elsewhere2have indicated two clear features: a strong negative yield response to accumulation of temperatures above 30 °C (or extreme degree days (EDD)), and a relatively weak response to seasonal rainfall. Here we show that the process-based Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is able to reproduce both of these relationships in the Midwestern United States and provide insight into underlying mechanisms. The predominant effects of EDD in APSIM are associated with increased vapour pressure deficit, which contributes to water stress in two ways: by increasing demand for soil water to sustain a given rate of carbon assimilation, and by reducing future supply of soil water by raising transpiration rates. APSIM computes daily water stress as the ratio of water supply to demand, and during the critical month of July this ratio is three times more responsive to 2 °C warming than to a 20% precipitation reduction. The results suggest a relatively minor role for direct heat stress on reproductive organs at present temperatures in this region. Effects of elevated CO2on transpiration efficiency should reduce yield sensitivity to EDD in the coming decades, but at most by 25%."

In particular, relationships between the relatively slow changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and climate variability at widely removed points across the globe provide a basis for statistical and dynamical efforts to predict numerous phenomena, from rainfall to disease incidence, at seasonal to decadal timescales. We describe here a remote influence, identified through observational analysis and supported through numerical experiments with a coupled atmosphere–ocean model, of the tropical South Atlantic (TSA) on both monsoon rainfall and malaria epidemics in arid northwest India. Moreover, SST in the TSA is shown to provide the basis for an early warning of anomalous hydrological conditions conducive to malaria epidemics four months later, therefore at longer lead times than those afforded by rainfall. We find that the TSA is not only significant as a modulator of the relationship between the monsoon and the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, as has been suggested by previous work3,4, but for certain regions and temporal lags is in fact a dominant driver of rainfall variability and hence malaria outbreaks."

Spatial patterns in the onset of annual bleaching conditions are similar for each of the RCPs. For RCP 8.5, 26% of reef cells are projected to experience annual bleaching conditions more than 5 years later than the median. Some of these temporary refugia include the western Indian Ocean, Thailand, the southern Great Barrier Reef and central French Polynesia. A reduction in the growth of greenhouse-gas emissions corresponding to the difference between RCP 8.5 and 6.0 delays annual bleaching in∼23% of reef cells more than two decades, which might conceivably increase the potential for these reefs to cope with these changes."

State-of-the-art palaeoclimatic methods routinely use hydroclimatic proxies to reconstruct temperature (for example, refs3,4), possibly blurring differences in the variability continuum of temperature and precipitation before the instrumental period. Here, we assess the spectral characteristics of temperature and precipitation fluctuations in observations, model simulations and proxy records across the globe. We find that whereas an ensemble of different general circulation models represents patterns captured in instrumental measurements, such as land–ocean contrasts and enhanced low-frequency tropical variability, the tree-ring-dominated proxy collection does not. The observed dominance of inter-annual precipitation fluctuations is not reflected in the annually resolved hydroclimatic proxy records. Likewise, temperature-sensitive proxies overestimate, on average, the ratio of low- to high-frequency variability. These spectral biases in the proxy records seem to propagate into multi-proxy climate reconstructions for which we observe an overestimation of low-frequency signals. Thus, a proper representation of the high- to low-frequency spectrum in proxy records is needed to reduce uncertainties in climate reconstruction efforts."
Energy consumption and the unexplained winter warming over northern Asia and North America,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1803,nature_articles/images_2013/Energy consumption and the unexplained winter warming over northern Asia and North America.jpg,Research shows that incorporating energy consumption in a global climate model can explain past surface temperature changes of as much as 1 K in mid and high latitudes in winter and autumn over most part of North America and Eurasia.

Zhang, Ming Cai, Aixue Hu",No publication date,Letter,"The worldwide energy consumption in 2006 was close to 498 exajoules. This is equivalent to an energy convergence of 15.8 TW into the populated regions, where energy is consumed and dissipated into the atmosphere as heat. Although energy consumption is sparsely distributed over the vast Earth surface and is only about 0.3% of the total energy transport to the extratropics by atmospheric and oceanic circulations, this anthropogenic heating could disrupt the normal atmospheric circulation pattern and produce a far-reaching effect on surface air temperature. We identify the plausible climate impacts of energy consumption using a global climate model. The results show that the inclusion of energy use at 86 model grid points where it exceeds 0.4 W m−2can lead to remote surface temperature changes by as much as 1 K in mid- and high latitudes in winter and autumn over North America and Eurasia. These regions correspond well to areas with large differences in surface temperature trends between observations and global warming simulations forced by all natural and anthropogenic forcings1. We conclude that energy consumption is probably a missing forcing for the additional winter warming trends in observations."

Frey, Juhwan Lee, Johan Six",No publication date,Letter,"Soils are the largest repository of organic carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere and represent an important source of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, releasing 60–75 Pg C annually through microbial decomposition of organic materials1,2. A primary control on soil CO2flux is the efficiency with which the microbial community uses C. Despite its critical importance to soil–atmosphere CO2exchange, relatively few studies have examined the factors controlling soil microbial efficiency. Here, we measured the temperature response of microbial efficiency in soils amended with substrates varying in lability. We also examined the temperature sensitivity of microbial efficiency in response to chronic soil warmingin situ. We find that the efficiency with which soil microorganisms use organic matter is dependent on both temperature and substrate quality, with efficiency declining with increasing temperatures for more recalcitrant substrates. However, the utilization efficiency of a more recalcitrant substrate increased at higher temperatures in soils exposed to almost two decades of warming 5 °C above ambient. Our work suggests that climate warming could alter the decay dynamics of more stable organic matter compounds, thereby having a positive feedback to climate that is attenuated by a shift towards a more efficient microbial community in the longer term."

The biosphere is the main source of VOCs, with an estimated 1,150 TgC yr−1(∼90% of total VOC emissions) released from vegetation globally4. Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) is the most significant biogenic VOC in terms of mass (around 500 TgC yr−1) and chemical reactivity4and plays an important role in the mediation of ground-level ozone concentrations5. Concerns about climate change and energy security are driving an aggressive expansion of bioenergy crop production and many of these plant species emit more isoprene than the traditional crops they are replacing. Here we quantify the increases in isoprene emission rates caused by cultivation of 72 Mha of biofuel crops in Europe. We then estimate the resultant changes in ground-level ozone concentrations and the impacts on human mortality and crop yields that these could cause. Our study highlights the need to consider more than simple carbon budgets when considering the cultivation of biofuel feedstock crops for greenhouse-gas mitigation."

Arctic soil carbon trajectories shaped by plant–microbe interactions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02147-3,nature_articles/images_2024/Arctic soil carbon trajectories shaped by plant_microbe interactions.jpg,Arctic warming is thought to lead to large losses in soil carbon stocks. Here a 35-year-long fertilization experiment in Alaska shows that increased shrub productivity and changes in plant–microbial feedbacks may eventually reverse trends of carbon loss and restore the soil carbon sink.,"Megan B. Machmuller, Laurel M. Lynch, Matthew D. Wallenstein",No publication date,Article,"Rapid warming in the Arctic threatens to amplify climate change by releasing the region’s vast stocks of soil carbon to the atmosphere. Increased nutrient availability may exacerbate soil carbon losses by stimulating microbial decomposition or offset them by increasing primary productivity. The outcome of these competing feedbacks remains unclear. Here we present results from a long-term nutrient addition experiment in northern Alaska, United States, coupled with a mechanistic isotope-tracing experiment. We found that soil carbon losses observed during the first 20 years of fertilization were caused by microbial priming and were completely reversed in the subsequent 15 years by shrub expansion which promoted an increasingly efficient carbon–nitrogen economy. Incorporating long-term stoichiometric responses in Earth system models will improve predictions of the magnitude, direction and timing of the Arctic carbon–climate feedback."
Climate variability shifts the vertical structure of phytoplankton in the Sargasso Sea,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02136-6,nature_articles/images_2024/Climate variability shifts the vertical structure of phytoplankton in the Sargasso Sea.jpg,"The authors reveal distinct trends in surface and subsurface phytoplankton dynamics, highlighting the need for subsurface monitoring. Whereas subsurface phytoplankton respond to recent warming with biomass increases, surface phytoplankton show altered carbon-to-chlorophyll ratios but minimal biomass change.","Johannes J. Viljoen, Xuerong Sun, Robert J. W. Brewin",No publication date,Article,"Marine phytoplankton are essential to ocean biogeochemical cycles. However, our understanding of changes in phytoplankton rely largely on satellite data, which can only assess changes in surface phytoplankton. How climate variability is impacting their vertical structure remains unclear. Here we use 33 years’ worth of data from the Sargasso Sea to show distinct seasonal and long-term phytoplankton climate responses in the surface mixed layer compared with the subsurface. Seasonally, the surface community alters their carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio without changing their carbon biomass, whereas the chlorophyllaand carbon of the subsurface community covaries with no change in their carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio. Over the last decade, the subsurface phytoplankton biomass has increased in response to warming, whereas the surface phytoplankton have altered their carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio with minimal change in their carbon biomass. Given that satellites can only view the surface ocean, sustained subsurface monitoring is required to provide a full understanding of how phytoplankton are responding to climate change."
Using cost–benefit analyses to identify key opportunities in demand-side mitigation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02146-4,nature_articles/images_2024/Using cost_benefit analyses to identify key opportunities in demand-side mitigation.jpg,"Demand-side mitigation solutions are seen as an essential part for climate actions, yet their adoption is still lower than expected. Cost–benefit analysis shows that the main barriers lie in the non-pecuniary costs of behaviour switching, and highlights opportunities for targeted policy intervention.","Jie-Sheng Tan-Soo, Ping Qin, Xiaoxi Wang",No publication date,Article,"Demand-side mitigation relies on individuals’ and households’ willingness to alter their consumption habits and daily routines to reduce their carbon footprint. Despite optimistic forecasts for well-being improvements, broad adoption of these behavioural changes remains elusive. Our study analyses 12 behaviours in Beijing, China, using a cost–benefit approach that includes both tangible (pecuniary) and intangible (non-pecuniary) benefits. Our findings indicate that eight behaviours result in individual-level welfare loss. Even after accounting for mitigation benefits, seven behaviours still incur social-welfare loss. Monte Carlo simulations unveil substantial variability in welfare impacts, highlighting opportunities for targeted policy interventions. Depending on the perspective (individual versus societal) and the goal (welfare versus mitigation), we recommend four demand-side practices for Beijing policymakers. In addition, we propose actionable steps on the basis of sensitivity analyses. This study underscores the need for an objective and universally applicable framework to evaluate demand-side behaviours and optimize emissions reduction potential."
Feasible deployment of carbon capture and storage and the requirements of climate targets,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02104-0,nature_articles/images_2024/Feasible deployment of carbon capture and storage and the requirements of climate targets.jpg,"Carbon capture and storage is a key component of mitigation scenarios, yet its feasibility is debated. An analysis based on historical trends in policy-driven technologies, current plans and their failure rates shows that a number of 2 °C pathways are feasible, but most 1.5 °C pathways are not.","Tsimafei Kazlou, Aleh Cherp, Jessica Jewell",No publication date,Article,"Climate change mitigation requires the large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Recent plans indicate an eight-fold increase in CCS capacity by 2030, yet the feasibility of CCS expansion is debated. Using historical growth of CCS and other policy-driven technologies, we show that if plans double between 2023 and 2025 and their failure rates decrease by half, CCS could reach 0.37 GtCO2yr−1by 2030—lower than most 1.5 °C pathways but higher than most 2 °C pathways. Staying on-track to 2 °C would require that in 2030–2040 CCS accelerates at least as fast as wind power did in the 2000s, and that after 2040, it grows faster than nuclear power did in the 1970s to 1980s. Only 10% of mitigation pathways meet these feasibility constraints, and virtually all of them depict <600 GtCO2captured and stored by 2100. Relaxing the constraints by assuming no failures of CCS plans and growth as fast as flue-gas desulfurization would approximately double this amount."
Ocean warming as a trigger for irreversible retreat of the Antarctic ice sheet,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02134-8,nature_articles/images_2024/Ocean warming as a trigger for irreversible retreat of the Antarctic ice sheet.jpg,"The Filchner–Ronne and Ross ice shelves are two of the largest in Antarctica. Here the authors show their vulnerability to warming ocean conditions, where a transition to warmer waters in the ice shelf cavities could lead to accelerated ice loss and grounding line retreat.","Emily A. Hill, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson, David M. Chandler",No publication date,Article,"Warmer ocean conditions could impact future ice loss from Antarctica due to their ability to thin and reduce the buttressing of laterally confined ice shelves. Previous studies highlight the potential for a cold to warm ocean regime shift within the sub-shelf cavities of the two largest Antarctic ice shelves—the Filchner–Ronne and Ross. However, how this impacts upstream ice flow and mass loss has not been quantified. Here using an ice sheet model and an ensemble of ocean-circulation model sub-shelf melt rates, we show that transition to a warm state in those ice shelf cavities leads to a destabilization and irreversible grounding line retreat in some locations. Once this ocean shift takes place, ice loss from the Filchner–Ronne and Ross catchments is greatly accelerated, and conditions begin to resemble those of the present-day Amundsen Sea sector—responsible for most current observed Antarctic ice loss—where this thermal shift has already occurred."
Limited net poleward movement of reef species over a decade of climate extremes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02116-w,nature_articles/images_2024/Limited net poleward movement of reef species over a decade of climate extremes.jpg,"The authors use 12 years of broadscale survey data across 838 temperate and tropical coastal sites to investigate shifts in marine taxa range edges at the community level. They show that while some species respond rapidly to change, evidence for mass poleward migration is limited.","Yann Herrera Fuchs, Graham J. Edgar, Rick D. Stuart-Smith",No publication date,Article,"Warming seas are expected to drive marine life poleward. However, few systematic observations confirm movement among entire communities at both warm and cool range edges. We analysed two continent-scale reef monitoring datasets to quantify changes in latitudinal range edges of 662 Australian shallow-water reef fishes and invertebrates over a decade punctuated by climate extremes. Temperate and tropical species both showed little net movement overall, with retreat often balancing expansion across the continent. Within regions, however, range edges shifted ~100 km per decade, on average, in the poleward or equatorward directions expected from warming or cooling. Although some species responded rapidly to temperature change, we found little evidence for mass poleward migration over the decade. Previous studies based on extreme species observations, rather than tracking all species through time, may have overestimated the prevalence, magnitude and longevity of range shifts amongst marine taxa."
Carbon dioxide emissions from global overseas coal-fired power plants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02114-y,nature_articles/images_2024/Carbon dioxide emissions from global overseas coal-fired power plants.jpg,"Foreign investments in recent years drive the expansion of fossil fuel electricity generation in emerging economies, yet necessary quantification still lacks. This Article shows how overseas coal-fired power plants could drive future trajectories of CO2 emissions in host countries.","Peng Guo, Huizhong Shen, Shu Tao",No publication date,Article,"Foreign investments in overseas coal-fired power plants (OCPs) largely impede decarbonization efforts, yet their global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have not been sufficiently quantified. Here we analyse investment data from 908 OCPs worldwide, and then reveal current annual emissions of 0.53 GtCO2yr−1and a historical cumulative total of 26 GtCO2. Developed nations account for 78% of these cumulative emissions on the basis of investments, while emissions from developing nations have surged from 8% in 1960 to 39% in 2022. Assuming unchanged policies and technologies, OCPs are projected to contribute an additional 15–30 GtCO2in cumulative emissions by 2060 directly. Furthermore, they could stimulate local coal power growth in emerging economies, potentially adding 6.3–45.0 GtCO2emissions indirectly. Our study underscores the critical importance of low-carbon policy interventions in emerging countries to curb the power-sector carbon emissions increasingly influenced by international capital."
Disproportionate impact of atmospheric heat events on lake surface water temperature increases,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02122-y,nature_articles/images_2024/Disproportionate impact of atmospheric heat events on lake surface water temperature increases.jpg,"Lake surface water temperatures have increased over recent decades, mainly driven by atmospheric conditions. Here the authors demonstrate that heat events drive a disproportionately large part of this lake surface warming and increases in lake heatwaves.","Xiwen Wang, Kun Shi, R. Iestyn Woolway",No publication date,Article,"Hot temperature extremes (HTEs) in the atmosphere can also affect lake surface water temperature, but how this impact changes with global warming is not well understood. Here we use numerical modelling and satellite observations to quantify the contribution of HTEs to variations in summer lake surface water temperature and lake heatwaves in 1,260 water bodies worldwide between 1979 and 2022. Over this time period, HTE duration and cumulative intensity over the studied lakes increased significantly, at average rates of 1.4 days per decade and 0.92 °C days per decade, respectively. Despite only accounting for 7% of the total summer days, HTEs are responsible for 24% of lake surface summer warming trends, with the most pronounced effect observed in Europe at 27%. Moreover, HTEs are key drivers of both the duration and cumulative intensity of lake heatwaves. Our findings underscore the pivotal role played by short-term climatic extreme events in shaping long-term lake surface water temperature dynamics."
Rising cause-specific mortality risk and burden of compound heatwaves amid climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02137-5,nature_articles/images_2024/Rising cause-specific mortality risk and burden of compound heatwaves amid climate change.jpg,"The authors analyse data from 272 Chinese cities, projecting that compound heatwaves will cause higher burdens for all major cardiopulmonary diseases than daytime or nighttime heatwaves, especially under scenarios with higher emissions and ageing and in areas with high summer temperature variability.","Jiangdong Liu, Jinlei Qi, Maigeng Zhou",No publication date,Article,"Global warming shifts daytime-only heatwaves to nighttime-only and day–night compound heatwaves. However, evidence on the cause-specific burdens of these heatwaves in a changing climate and ageing population is limited. Here, by analysing 1,088,742 non-accidental deaths from 272 Chinese cities, we found that compound heatwaves posed significantly higher cardiopulmonary mortality risks and burdens than daytime-only and nighttime-only heatwaves, particularly for ischaemic stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and regions with high summer temperature variation. Projections suggested substantial increases in compound heatwave-related mortality (4.0–7.6-fold) by the 2090s relative to the 2010s under medium and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios, outpacing nighttime-only heatwaves (0.7–1.9-fold) and contrasting with decreasing daytime heatwave-related mortality (0.3–0.8-fold). A strict emission control scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 1-1.9) may reverse most heatwave-related mortality increases. The confluence of global warming and ageing amplifies heatwave-related burdens, outstripping the sum of their individual impacts. Our findings underscore the importance of addressing compound heatwaves amid global warming."
Acceleration of Drosophila subobscura evolutionary response to global warming in Europe,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02128-6,nature_articles/images_2024/Acceleration of Drosophila subobscura evolutionary response to global warming in Europe.jpg,"The authors resurvey data from the present, late 1960s and late 1990s to understand the evolution of European Drosophila fly populations. They show that genetic changes in temperate regions have accelerated in line with warming and come from pre-existing rather than new variation.","Francisco Rodríguez-Trelles, Rosa Tarrío",No publication date,Article,"The increasing risk of irreversible ecological transformation under global warming has boosted the need to understand the capacity of organisms to adapt to this change. Here, using a resurvey method of populations of the European flyDrosophila subobscura, we show that a known evolutionary response to global warming has accelerated in the past 20 years, in step with regional warming. This genetic response has come entirely by resorting pre-existing variation—and not from novel inversions—for tolerance to high temperature. Temperate populations are predicted to converge to the typical Mediterranean chromosomal composition by the mid-2050s, at which point this classic example of steep genetic cline will have vanished. Our results suggest that species with broad geographic ranges, large population sizes and high genetic diversity may have the evolutionary potential to cope with climate change."
Elevated urban energy risks due to climate-driven biophysical feedbacks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02108-w,nature_articles/images_2024/Elevated urban energy risks due to climate-driven biophysical feedbacks.jpg,"Climate change affects the energy demand for heating and cooling in cities, which in turn leads to additional urban warming. Here, the authors show that when including such two-way biophysical feedbacks, the cooling (heating) energy demand more than doubles (is halved) under high emissions.","Xinchang ‘Cathy’ Li, Lei Zhao, Yiwen Zhang",No publication date,Article,"Climate-driven impacts on future urban heating and cooling (H&C) energy demand are critical to sustainable energy planning. Existing global H&C projections are predominantly made without accounting for future two-way biophysical feedbacks between urban climate and H&C use. Here, using a hybrid modelling framework we show that the prevalent degree-days methods misrepresent the magnitude, nonlinearity and uncertainty in the climate-driven projections of H&C energy demand changes due to the missing two-way feedbacks. We find a 220% increase (47% decrease) in cooling (heating) energy demand with amplified uncertainty by 2099 under a very high emission scenario, roughly twice that projected by previous methods. The spatially diverse H&C demand responses to the warming climates highlight the disparate challenges faced by individual cities and necessitate urban energy planning accounting for local climate–energy interactions. Our study underscores the critical necessity of explicit and dynamic modelling of urban H&C energy use for climate-sensitive energy planning."
Global patterns and drivers of tropical aboveground carbon changes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02115-x,nature_articles/images_2024/Global patterns and drivers of tropical aboveground carbon changes.jpg,"Tropical aboveground biomass carbon is a crucial, yet complex, component of the terrestrial C budget. Here remote observations demonstrate that fire emissions and post-fire recovery in non-forested African biomes dominate the interannual variability of aboveground biomass carbon, which acts as a moderate net C sink.","Yu Feng, Philippe Ciais, Zhenzhong Zeng",No publication date,Article,"Tropical terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in modulating the global carbon balance. However, the complex dynamics and factors controlling tropical aboveground live biomass carbon (AGC) are not fully understood. Here, using remotely sensed observations, we find a moderate net AGC sink of 0.21 ± 0.06 PgC yr−1throughout the global tropics from 2010 to 2020. This arises from a gross loss of −1.79 PgC yr−1offset by a marked gain of 2.01 ± 0.06 PgC yr−1. Fire emissions in non-forested African shrubland/savanna biomes, coupled with post-fire carbon recovery, substantially dominated the interannual variability of tropical AGC. Fire radiative power was identified as the primary determinant of the spatial variability in AGC gains, with soil moisture also playing a crucial role in shaping trends. We highlight the dominant roles of anthropogenic and hydroclimatic determinants in orchestrating tropical land carbon dynamics and advocate for land management to conserve indispensable ecosystem services worldwide."
Fisheries track the future redistribution of marine species,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02127-7,nature_articles/images_2024/Fisheries track the future redistribution of marine species.jpg,"The authors consider environmental niche models for the current and future distribution of fishing fleets and gear from 82 countries. Despite overall redistribution of fleets to the poles, they show that most nations—particularly tropical ones—may struggle to track expected fish stock shifts.","Leonardo Cruz, Maria Pennino, Priscila Lopes",No publication date,Article,"The redistribution of fish stocks induced by climate change is expected to have global implications for fisheries, particularly the poleward shifts of species. However, the responses of different fishing gears and fleet of countries and their potential attempts to spatially redistribute catches remain unknown. Here, by developing environmental niche models for industrial fisheries of 82 countries and 13 fishing gears, we demonstrate that without management, global fleets are expected to shift poleward by the end of the century. This is driven by polar fishing gears moving to higher Arctic areas and tropical fishing gears expanding both within the tropics and poleward. Most nations, particularly tropical ones, may struggle to track these shifts, as they largely rely on coastal and nearshore fishing gears, such as trawlers. Our findings highlight the need to consider future shifts of fisheries in their management, to ensure the long-term sustainability and accessibility of fish stocks."
Underestimation of personal carbon footprint inequality in four diverse countries,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02130-y,nature_articles/images_2024/Underestimation of personal carbon footprint inequality in four diverse countries.jpg,"Existing studies show carbon footprint inequality between and within countries, but awareness of this inequality is unclear.

Of the 4,003 participants, within each country, 50% of participants were sampled from the top 10% income group. Our results show links between carbon footprint inequality perceptions and climate policy support, but with significant variations observed across the four countries and with participants’ income segments. Furthermore, there are links to the perceived fairness of actual carbon footprint inequality, highlighting the need to raise awareness about carbon footprint inequality and further unpack its implications for climate justice and policy."

Abel",No publication date,Article,"Healthcare delivery contributes to carbon emissions, exacerbating climate change and its associated health impacts. There is limited understanding of stakeholder views regarding ethical issues at the intersection of health choices and environmental impact. Here we performed a qualitative study involving seven focus groups with 46 participants who were patients and physicians in the northeastern US health systems. Both patients and physicians were amenable to health decisions that are beneficial for the environment and health. A consumptive healthcare system impeded both groups’ assumption of health-related climate responsibilities. Physicians, however, underestimated patients’ interest in discussing the environmental impacts of health decisions. Patients expressed tension between a personal interest in limiting climate change through health choices and ensuring others were also accountable; they were also concerned that physician paternalism might impede climate-informed health conversations. These findings outline barriers to climate-informed healthcare and begin to establish how they can be addressed."

Bousfield, Oscar Morton, David P. Edwards",No publication date,Article,"Timber and agricultural production must both increase throughout this century to meet rising demand. Understanding how climate-induced shifts in agricultural suitability will trigger competition with timber for productive land is crucial. Here, we combine predictions of agricultural suitability under different climate change scenarios (representative concentration pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) with timber-production maps to show that 240–320 Mha (20–26%) of current forestry land will become more suitable for agriculture by 2100. Forestry land contributes 21–27% of new agricultural productivity frontiers (67–105 Mha) despite only occupying 10% of the surface of the land. Agricultural frontiers in forestry land occur disproportionately in key timber-producing nations (Russia, the USA, Canada and China) and are closer to population centres and existing cropland than frontiers outside forestry land. To minimize crop expansion into forestry land and prevent shifting timber harvests into old-growth tropical and boreal forests to meet timber demand, emissions must be reduced, agricultural efficiency improved and sustainable intensification invested in."

However, phenol oxidase response to field drainage is highly uncertain, constraining our ability to predict wetland carbon–climate feedbacks. Here, using literature data, laboratory simulations and a pair-wise survey of 30 diverse wetlands experiencing long-term (15–55 years) drainage across China, we show that while short-term drainage generally leads to increased phenol oxidative activity, its response to long-term drainage diverges inSphagnumversus non-Sphagnumwetlands. In non-Sphagnumwetlands, long-term drainage is linked to increased plant secondary metabolites and decreased phenol oxidase-producing microbes, while inSphagnumwetlands, drainage is linked to replacement of antimicrobialSphagnumby vascular plants and increased phenol oxidative activity with cascading effects on hydrolytic enzymes. Our findings highlight that trait-based plant dynamics are pivotal to decipher wetland carbon dynamics and feedback to climate change under shifting hydrological regimes."

Davies, E. M. Wolkovich",No publication date,Article,"The ability to adapt to climate change requires accurate ecological forecasting. Current forecasts, however, have failed to capture important variability in biological responses, especially across species. Here we present a new method using Bayesian hierarchical phylogenetic models and show that species-level differences are larger than the average differences between cues. Applying our method to phenological experiments manipulating temperature and day length we show an underlying phylogenetic structure in plant phenological responses to temperature cues, whereas responses to photoperiod appear weaker, more uniform across species and less phylogenetically constrained. We thus illustrate how a focus on certain clades can bias prediction, but that predictions may be improved by integrating information on phylogeny to better estimate species-level responses. Our approach provides an advance in ecological forecasting, with implications for predicting the impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic forces on ecosystems."
Reducing climate change impacts from the global food system through diet shifts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02084-1,nature_articles/images_2024/Reducing climate change impacts from the global food system through diet shifts.jpg,"Food choices greatly affect global GHG emissions, but the contributions of different groups, across or within countries, are highly unequal. Adopting the global planetary health diet could yield co-benefits by reducing both emissions and inequality among populations.","Yanxian Li, Pan He, Klaus Hubacek",No publication date,Article,"How much and what we eat and where it is produced can create huge differences in GHG emissions. On the basis of detailed household-expenditure data, we evaluate the unequal distribution of dietary emissions from 140 food products in 139 countries or areas and further model changes in emissions of global diet shifts. Within countries, consumer groups with higher expenditures generally cause more dietary emissions due to higher red meat and dairy intake. Such inequality is more pronounced in low-income countries. The present global annual dietary emissions would fall by 17% with the worldwide adoption of the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet, primarily attributed to shifts from red meat to legumes and nuts as principal protein sources. More than half (56.9%) of the global population, which is presently overconsuming, would save 32.4% of global emissions through diet shifts, offsetting the 15.4% increase in global emissions from presently underconsuming populations moving towards healthier diets."

The feasibility of limiting warming to 1.5 °C is therefore questioned. Here we present a model intercomparison study that accounts for emissions trends until 2023 and compares cost-effective scenarios to alternative scenarios with institutional, geophysical and technological feasibility constraints and enablers informed by previous literature. Our results show that the most ambitious mitigation trajectories with updated climate information still manage to limit peak warming to below 1.6 °C (‘low overshoot’) with around 50% likelihood. However, feasibility constraints, especially in the institutional dimension, decrease this maximum likelihood considerably to 5–45%. Accelerated energy demand transformation can reduce costs for staying below 2 °C but have only a limited impact on further increasing the likelihood of limiting warming to 1.6 °C. Our study helps to establish a new benchmark of mitigation scenarios that goes beyond the dominant cost-effective scenario design."

Here we represent coastal permafrost erosion in an Earth system model and perform simulations with varying permafrost organic matter properties, such as sinking fraction and nutrient content. We find that coastal erosion reduces the Arctic Ocean CO2uptake from the atmosphere in all simulations: by 4.6–13.2 TgC yr−1by 2100, which is ~7–14% of the Inner Arctic Ocean uptake. We show that coastal permafrost erosion exerts a positive biogeochemical feedback on climate, increasing atmospheric CO2by 1–2 TgC yr−1per °C of increase in global surface air temperature. Our work will allow coastal permafrost erosion to be considered in future climate change assessments."

Many scientists already engage in individual lifestyle changes, but fewer engage in advocacy or activism. On the basis of our quantitative and qualitative results, we propose a two-step model of engagement to better understand why. Scientists must first overcome intellectual and practical barriers to be willing to engage, and then overcome additional barriers to actually engage. On the basis of this model, we provide concrete recommendations for increasing scientists’ engagement with climate change."

Using machine learning and matching techniques, we examine the Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS), a set of lands where these federal incentives have been removed. We find that the policy leads to lower development densities inside designated areas, increases development in neighbouring areas, reduces flood damages and alters local demographics. Our results suggest that the CBRS generates substantial savings for the federal government by reducing flood claims in the National Flood Insurance Program, while increasing the property tax base in coastal counties."

We find that soil biogeochemistry explained the majority of variation in both MAOC and POC. Both carbon fractions decreased with increases in mean annual temperature and reductions in precipitation, with MAOC responding similarly to POC. Therefore, our results suggest that ongoing climate warming and aridification may result in unforeseen carbon losses across global drylands, and that the protective role of minerals may not dampen these effects."

However, using high-resolution global climate simulations, here we demonstrate that the total ocean kinetic energy is projected to be significantly reduced in a warming climate, despite overall acceleration of large-scale ocean circulations in the upper layer. This reduction is primarily attributed to weakened ocean mesoscale eddies in the deep ocean. Enhanced vertical stratification under global warming reduces the available potential energy stored in large-scale ocean circulations, diminishing its conversion into eddy kinetic energy. Our findings reveal a more quiescent deep ocean under global warming and suggest a crucial role of mesoscale eddies in determining the anthropogenic change of total ocean kinetic energy."

Thus, recent non-growing-season CO2losses have substantially impacted the CO2balance of permafrost ecosystems. Furthermore, analysis of interannual variability reveals warmer summers amplify the C cycle (increase productivity and respiration) at putatively nitrogen-limited sites and at sites less reliant on summer precipitation for water use. Our findings suggest that water and nutrient availability will be important predictors of the C-cycle response of these ecosystems to future warming."

With continued warming, selection ratio falls 8.5% and stability falls 8.7% for each 1 °C increase in local temperature. Overall, faced with more climate variability, breeders need to revisit their breeding strategies to integrate genetic diversity that confers climate resilience without penalties to productivity in favourable seasons."

The existing focus on habitat loss thus severely underestimates biodiversity impacts of sea-level rise. Shorebirds will also suffer much sooner than previously thought, despite adapting by moving to higher grounds and even if global warming is kept below 2 °C. Such unavoidable and imminent biodiversity impacts imply that mitigation is now urgently needed to boost the resilience of marshes or provide flood-safe habitat elsewhere."

Continued warming beyond 2100 pushes sea surface temperature above the convective threshold over the eastern Pacific, causing collapsed mean equatorial upwelling with intensified deep convection. We show that the weakened thermocline feedback due to the collapsed upwelling and increased thermal expansion coefficient, along with enhanced thermodynamic damping, are crucial to reducing ENSO amplitude under sustained warming. Our results suggest a threshold behaviour in the tropical Pacific, where a convective atmosphere over the eastern equatorial Pacific causes dramatic shifts in ENSO variability. This threshold is not crossed under low-emission scenarios."

Here, using scenarios consistent with the 1.5 °C target, we show that demand and technological interventions can substantially lower emission levels in four hard-to-abate sectors (industry, agriculture, buildings and transport) and reduce reliance on the use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Specifically, demand measures and technology-oriented measures could limit peak annual bioenergy with carbon capture and storage use to 0.5–2.2 GtCO2e per year and 1.9–7.0 GtCO2e per year, respectively, compared with 10.3 GtCO2e per year in the default 1.5 °C scenario. Dietary change plays a critical role in the demand measures given its large share in residual agricultural emissions."

Soil C is particularly vulnerable in low-productivity ecosystems (for example, deserts), which are subjected to a greater number of global change stressors exceeding medium–high levels of stress simultaneously. Taken together, our work indicates that the number of global change stressors is a crucial factor for soil C storage and persistence worldwide."

The high-resolution ensemble exhibits a 20% larger warming rate for 2006–2100 compared with standard low-resolution model simulations. The enhanced Arctic warming in the high-resolution simulations is primarily attributable to an increased OHT through the narrow and shallow Bering Strait that is nearly four times larger than in the low-resolution simulations. Consequently, the projected rate of Arctic warming by low-resolution climate simulations is likely to be underestimated due to the model resolution being insufficient to capture future changes in Bering Strait OHT."

This results from a thermodynamic amplification of the existing spatial unevenness in relative humidity, with the wettest basin getting wetter and the driest basin getting drier. The diverging basin hydrological sensitivity is accompanied by an interbasin repartitioning of latent heating and convective mass fluxes, with far-reaching implications on rainfall and surface temperature over tropical and mid-latitude lands.

Model-based financial regulations impair the transition to net-zero carbon emissions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-01972-w,nature_articles/images_2024/Model-based financial regulations impair the transition to net-zero carbon emissions.jpg,"As the financial system is increasingly important in catalysing the green transition, it is critical to assess the impediments it may face. This study shows that existing financial regulations may impair the shift of financial resources from high-carbon to low-carbon assets.","Matteo Gasparini, Matthew C. Ives, Eric Beinhocker",No publication date,Article,"Investments via the financial system are essential for fostering the green transition. However, the role of existing financial regulations in influencing investment decisions is understudied. Here we analyse data from the European Banking Authority to show that existing financial accounting frameworks might inadvertently be creating disincentives for investments in low-carbon assets. We find that differences in the provision coverage ratio indicate that banks must account for nearly double the loan loss provisions for lending to low-carbon sectors as compared with high-carbon sectors. This bias is probably the result of basing risk estimates on historical data. We show that the average historical financial risk of the oil and gas sector has been consistently estimated to be lower than that of renewable energy. These results indicate that this bias could be present in other model-based regulations, such as capital requirements, and possibly impact the ability of banks to fund green investments."
Ageing population and green space dynamics for climate change adaptation in Southeast Asia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-01980-w,nature_articles/images_2024/Ageing population and green space dynamics for climate change adaptation in Southeast Asia.jpg,"Rapid population ageing is challenging for climate adaptation.

We find that cities with an increased concentration of elderly residents exhibit greater vulnerability due to inadequate green infrastructure provision. The findings reveal green space reduction in ageing communities, which is more pronounced in socio-economically disadvantaged, rapidly ageing cities. Nonetheless, coastal cities, facing higher climate risks, exhibit no such decline due to their functional demand.

To prevent this, a global minimum tax policy was approved by OECD countries in 2021. Global changes in corporate tax rates could reshape production and investment networks while impacting welfare and global emission patterns.

Implementing a global minimum tax rate of 15% would reduce global carbon emissions and effectively decrease the developing economies’ emissions. The results highlight that corporate tax policies should be coordinated with climate regulations."

We find that the increasing coastal CO2sink is primarily driven by biological responses to climate-induced changes in circulation (36%) and increasing riverine nutrient loads (23%), together exceeding the ocean CO2solubility pump (41%). The riverine impact is mediated by enhanced export of organic carbon across the shelf break, thereby adding to the carbon enrichment of the open ocean. The contribution of biological carbon fixation increases as the seawater capacity to hold CO2decreases under continuous climate change and ocean acidification. Our seamless coastal ocean integration advances carbon cycle model realism, which is relevant for addressing impacts of climate change mitigation efforts."

Here we use large-ensemble CO2ramp-up and ramp-down simulations to show that these changes are not reversed when CO2concentrations are reduced. If CO2is removed from the atmosphere following CO2increase, the North Atlantic storm track keeps strengthening until the middle of the CO2removal, while the recovery of the North Pacific storm track during ramp-down is stronger than its shift during ramp-up. By contrast, the Southern Hemisphere storm track weakens during ramp-down at a rate much faster than its strengthening in the warming period. Compared with the present climate, the Northern Hemisphere storm track becomes stronger and the Southern Hemisphere storm track becomes weaker at the end of CO2removal. These hemispherically asymmetric storm-track responses are attributable to the weakened Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and the delayed cooling of the Southern Ocean."

However, the experts suggested that some pathways, many with carbon credit eligibility and market activity, remain uncertain in terms of their climate mitigation efficacy. Sources of uncertainty include incomplete GHG measurement and accounting. We recommend focusing on resolving those uncertainties before broadly scaling implementation of those pathways in quantitative emission or sequestration mitigation plans. If appropriate, those pathways should be supported for their cobenefits, such as biodiversity and food security."

Here we show that a human-caused signal in the seasonal cycle of sea surface temperature (SST) has emerged from the noise of natural variability. Geographical patterns of changes in SST seasonal cycle amplitude (SSTAC) reveal two distinctive features: an increase at Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes related to mixed-layer depth changes and a robust dipole pattern between 40° S and 55° S that is mainly driven by surface wind changes. The model-predicted pattern of SSTACchange is identifiable with high statistical confidence in four observed SST products and in 51 individual model realizations of historical climate evolution. Simulations with individual forcings reveal that GHG increases are the primary driver of changes in SSTAC, with smaller but distinct contributions from anthropogenic aerosol and ozone forcing. The robust human ‘fingerprint’ identified here is likely to have wide-ranging impacts on marine ecosystems."

Berghuijs, Raoul A. Collenteur, Scott T. Allen",No publication date,Article,"Sustainable groundwater use relies on adequate rates of groundwater recharge, which are expected to change with climate change. However, climate impacts on recharge remain uncertain due to a paucity of measurements of recharge trends globally. Here we leverage the relationship between climatic aridity and long-term recharge measurements at 5,237 locations globally to identify regions where recharge is most sensitive to changes in climatic aridity. Recharge is most sensitive to climate changes in regions where potential evapotranspiration slightly exceeds precipitation, meaning even modest aridification can substantially decrease groundwater recharge. Future climate-induced recharge changes are expected to be dominated by precipitation changes, whereby changes in groundwater recharge will be amplified relative to precipitation changes. Recharge is more sensitive to changes in aridity than global hydrological models suggest. Consequently, the effects of climatic changes on groundwater replenishment and their impacts on the sustainability of groundwater use by humans and ecosystems probably exceed previous predictions."

Although climate change can generally promote population growth for lizards, deforestation can reverse these positive effects for 66% of simulated populations and further accelerate population declines for another 18%. Our research underscores the mechanistic link between tree availability and population survival and growth, thus advocating for forest conservation and the integration of biophysical modelling and microhabitat diversity into conservation strategies, particularly in the face of climate change."

However, flexible foraging behaviour could balance this effect by allowing predators to target specific prey species to maximize their energy intake, according to principles of optimal foraging theory. Here we test these assumptions using a large dataset comprising 2,487 stomach contents from six fish species with different feeding strategies, sampled across environments with varying prey availability over 12 years in Kiel Bay (Baltic Sea). Our results show that foraging shifts from trait- to density-dependent prey selectivity in warmer and more productive environments. This behavioural change leads to lower consumption efficiency at higher temperature as fish select more abundant but less energetically rewarding prey, thereby undermining species persistence and biodiversity. By integrating this behaviour into dynamic food web models, our study reveals that flexible foraging leads to lower species coexistence and biodiversity in communities under global warming."

The construction of new small water infrastructures (SWIs), such as deep wells and boreholes, is increasingly supported by climate resilience programmes of non-governmental organizations and national governments to improve water availability for agro-pastoralists, especially as an emergency response to extreme droughts. Although the short-term benefits of SWI are clear, their potential cumulative impact and their long-term effects on the resilience of dryland communities remain unclear. Here, building on in-depth anthropological literature from five key African drylands, we model post-drought pastoralists’ dynamics related to SWI. We show that while developing new SWI releases water shortages in the short term, it can erode traditional adaptation practices without adequate governance. We further illustrate how our model captures early quantitative signals of resilience loss in dryland Angola. This indicates that poorly governed water development in African drylands can be a limiting factor for the long-term resilience of pastoral communities facing a range of social, demographic, economic and climate challenges."

Here we resolve the magnitude and drivers of the mangrove CH4offset using multiple isotopic tracers across a latitudinal gradient. CH4emission offsets were smaller in high-salinity (~7%) than in freshwater-influenced (~27%) mangroves. Carbon sequestration was disproportionally high compared with CH4emissions in understudied tropical areas. Low CH4emissions were explained by minor freshwater inputs minimizing CH4production in saline, high-sulfate conditions and intense CH4oxidation in porewaters and surface waters. CH4oxidation in mangrove surface waters reduced potential aquatic CH4emissions by 10–33%. Overall, carbon sequestration through mangrove preservation and restoration is less affected by CH4emissions than previously thought."

The surface ocean warming is pronounced over subpolar to polar regions and the equatorial eastern Pacific where oceans are weakly stratified to allow vigorous heat release from the deep ocean to the surface layer. We also demonstrate that this ocean warming pattern largely explains changes in the precipitation pattern, including the southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and more moistening in high latitudes. This study suggests that deep ocean warming may hinder climate recovery in some regions, even if carbon neutrality or net negative emissions are successfully achieved."
Intensification of Pacific tropical instability waves over the recent three decades,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01915-x,nature_articles/images_2024/Intensification of Pacific tropical instability waves over the recent three decades.jpg,Tropical instability waves (TIWs) are an important component of the equatorial Pacific climate. Here the authors show that TIW activity has intensified in the central equatorial Pacific at ∼12 ± 6% per decade over the recent three decades.,"Minyang Wang, Shang-Ping Xie, Yan Du",No publication date,Article,"Tropical instability waves (TIWs) arise from shear instabilities of equatorial Pacific Ocean currents and are important for the tropical climate and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. Yet the long-term evolution of TIW activity under climate change remains unclear due to the difficulty in estimating equatorial current velocity. Here we use in situ, satellite altimeter and sea surface temperature observations along with a realistic eddy-resolving ocean simulation to show that TIW activity has intensified in the central equatorial Pacific at∼12 ± 6% per decade over the recent three decades. The extended satellite data and the ocean model simulation show that the increased TIW activity is probably caused by an enhanced cross-equatorial asymmetric warming in the eastern tropical Pacific. The intensified TIWs lead to increased eddy dynamic heating effects of∼70% since the 1990s near the equator, with implications for predicting and projecting tropical Pacific climate changes."
Warming causes contrasting spider behavioural responses by changing their prey size spectra,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01918-8,nature_articles/images_2024/Warming causes contrasting spider behavioural responses by changing their prey size spectra.jpg,"The authors show shifts in predatory spider web mesh size under experimental warming in an alpine meadow. Web mesh size decreased for a large spider species, but increased for a small species, with changes linked to altered prey size spectra following soil moisture and plant community shifts.","Xiaoli Hu, Xinwei Wu, Shucun Sun",No publication date,Article,"Predators may adapt to global warming via behavioural plasticity. However, empirical evidence showing such adaptations in terrestrial ecosystems is scarce. Here we report behavioural shifts that alter the web mesh size of two dominant predatory spider species in response to experimental warming in an alpine meadow field. Experimental large open-top chambers increased the mean annual air temperature by 0.6 °C, resulting in a decrease in the web mesh size of the large spider (−43.6%), and an increase in the web mesh size of the small spider (+79.8%). Structural equation models indicated that the changes in mesh size and web area were primarily the result of warming-induced changes in prey size spectra, which in turn were impacted by warming-induced changes in soil moisture and plant community. These results indicate that predators can adjust their behavioural responses to warming-induced changes in the physical setting and prey community."
Towards an increasingly biased view on Arctic change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01903-1,nature_articles/images_2024/Towards an increasingly biased view on Arctic change.jpg,"The authors investigate the impacts of excluding ecosystem data from Russian stations in the Arctic. While the current network of Arctic stations is already biased, the exclusion of Russian stations lowers representativeness and creates further biases that can rival end-of-century climate change shifts.","Efrén López-Blanco, Elmer Topp-Jørgensen, Niels M. Schmidt",No publication date,Brief Communication,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine hampers the ability to adequately describe conditions across the Arctic, thus biasing the view on Arctic change. Here we benchmark the pan-Arctic representativeness of the largest high-latitude research station network, INTERACT, with or without Russian stations. Excluding Russian stations lowers representativeness markedly, with some biases being of the same magnitude as the expected shifts caused by climate change by the end of the century."
Eddy activity in the Arctic Ocean projected to surge in a warming world,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01908-w,nature_articles/images_2024/Eddy activity in the Arctic Ocean projected to surge in a warming world.jpg,"Ocean eddies impact circulation, heat and gas fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere. Modelling how warming will alter their occurrence in the Arctic shows that sea ice decline and increased baroclinic instability drive an increase in eddy kinetic energy.","Xinyue Li, Qiang Wang, Thomas Jung",No publication date,Article,"Ocean eddies play a critical role in climate and marine life. In the rapidly warming Arctic, little is known about how ocean eddy activity will change because existing climate models cannot resolve Arctic Ocean mesoscale eddies. Here, by employing a next-generation global sea ice–ocean model with kilometre-scale horizontal resolution in the Arctic, we find a surge of eddy kinetic energy in the upper Arctic Ocean, tripling on average in a four-degree-warmer world. The driving mechanism behind this surge is an increase in eddy generation due to enhanced baroclinic instability. Despite the decline of sea ice, eddy killing (a process in which eddies are dampened by sea ice and winds) will not weaken in its annual mean effect in the considered warming scenario. Our study suggests the importance of adequately representing Arctic eddy activity in climate models for understanding the impacts of its increase on climate and ecosystems."
Hydrological cycle amplification reshapes warming-driven oxygen loss in the Atlantic Ocean,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01897-w,nature_articles/images_2024/Hydrological cycle amplification reshapes warming-driven oxygen loss in the Atlantic Ocean.jpg,"Oxygen loss has been observed in the world’s oceans, due mainly to warming temperatures that reduce oxygen solubility and increase stratification. This study shows climate-induced salinity changes also impact oxygen patterns with effects either accelerating or counteracting warming-driven changes.","Allison Hogikyan, Laure Resplandy, Gabriel Vecchi",No publication date,Article,"The loss of oxygen from the ocean due to warming is not ubiquitous. In the Atlantic Ocean above 1 km depth, there is oxygen loss at subpolar latitudes, but there has been no oxygen loss or gain in the subtropics over the past six decades. Here we show that the amplification of the hydrological cycle, a response to climate change that results in a ‘salty-get-saltier, fresh-get-fresher’ sea surface salinity pattern, influences ocean ventilation and introduces a spatial pattern in the rate of climate change-driven oxygen loss in an Earth system model. A salinification enhances ventilation of (already salty) mode waters that outcrop in the subtropics and opposes warming-driven oxygen loss, while a freshening reduces ventilation of (already fresh) deep waters that outcrop at subpolar latitudes and accelerates oxygen loss. These results suggest that climate change introduces patterns of oxygenation through surface salinity changes, key to understanding observed and future regional changes."
African rice cultivation linked to rising methane,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01907-x,nature_articles/images_2024/African rice cultivation linked to rising methane.jpg,"The increase in atmospheric methane has been accelerating since 2007, and identifying drivers is critical for climate mitigation. In this study, the authors show that the expansion of rice cultivation in Africa accounts for 7% of rising emissions.","Zichong Chen, Nicholas Balasus, Daniel J. Jacob",No publication date,Brief Communication,"Africa has been identified as a major driver of the current rise in atmospheric methane, and this has been attributed to emissions from wetlands and livestock. Here we show that rapidly increasing rice cultivation is another important source, and we estimate that it accounts for 7% of the current global rise in methane emissions. Continued rice expansion to feed a rapidly growing population should be considered in climate change mitigation goals."
Climate warming restructures food webs and carbon flow in high-latitude ecosystems,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01893-0,nature_articles/images_2024/Climate warming restructures food webs and carbon flow in high-latitude ecosystems.jpg,"The authors quantify changes in carbon flow to Arctic tundra and boreal forest consumers under warming. Small-mammal specimens separated by 30 years and wolf spiders from short-term warming experiments show similar patterns of change, switching from plant-based to fungal-based food webs.","Philip J. Manlick, Nolan L. Perryman, Seth D. Newsome",No publication date,Article,"Rapid warming of high-latitude ecosystems is increasing microbial activity and accelerating the decomposition of permafrost soils. This proliferation of microbial energy could restructure high-latitude food webs and alter carbon cycling between above-ground and below-ground habitats. We used stable isotope analysis (δ13C) of amino acids to trace carbon flow through food webs exposed to warming and quantified changes in the assimilation of microbial carbon by Arctic tundra and boreal forest consumers. From 1990 to 2021, small mammals in boreal forests exhibited a significant reduction in the use of plant-based ‘green’ food webs and an increased use of microbially mediated ‘brown’ food webs, punctuated by a >30% rise in fungal carbon assimilation. Similarly, fungal carbon assimilation rose 27% in wolf spiders under experimental warming in Arctic tundra. These findings reveal a climate-mediated ‘browning’ of high-latitude food webs and point to an understudied pathway by which animals can impact carbon cycling under climate warming."
The social costs of hydrofluorocarbons and the benefits from their expedited phase-down,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01898-9,nature_articles/images_2024/The social costs of hydrofluorocarbons and the benefits from their expedited phase-down.jpg,"Hydrofluorocarbons are a class of important greenhouse gases, and quantitative estimates of their social cost are still lacking. This research develops a set of direct estimates of their economic costs and shows their rapid phase-down could lead to large climate benefits.","Tammy Tan, Lisa Rennels, Bryan Parthum",No publication date,Article,"Hydrofluorocarbons are a potent greenhouse gas, yet there remains a lack of quantitative estimates of their social cost. The present study addresses this gap by directly calculating the social cost of hydrofluorocarbons (SC-HFCs) using perturbations of exogenous inputs to integrated assessment models. We first develop a set of direct estimates of the SC-HFCs using methods currently adopted by the United States Government and then derive updated estimates that incorporate recent advances in climate science and economics. We compare our estimates with commonly used social cost approximations based on global warming potentials to show that the latter is a poor proxy for direct calculation of hydrofluorocarbon emissions impacts using integrated assessment models. Applying our SC-HFCs to the Kigali Amendment, a global agreement to phase down HFCs, we estimate that it provides US$202037 trillion in climate benefits over its lifetime. Expediting the phase-down could increase the estimated climate benefits to US$202041 trillion."

Lack of uniform trends but increasing spatial variability in observed Indian rainfall extremes,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1327,nature_articles/images_2011/Lack of uniform trends but increasing spatial variability in observed Indian rainfall extremes.jpg,"Future changes in the Indian monsoon could affect millions of people, yet even the ways in which it might have changed over recent years remain uncertain. Statistical analysis indicates that during the second half of the twentieth century there were no spatially uniform changes in the frequency or intensity of heavy rainfall events over India, but there was an increase in the spatial variability of these characteristics.","Subimal Ghosh, Debasish Das, Auroop R. Ganguly",No publication date,Letter,"Recent studies disagree on how rainfall extremes over India have changed in space and time over the past half century1,2,3,4, as well as on whether the changes observed are due to global warming5,6or regional urbanization7. Although a uniform and consistent decrease in moderate rainfall has been reported1,3, a lack of agreement about trends in heavy rainfall may be due in part to differences in the characterization and spatial averaging of extremes. Here we use extreme value theory8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15to examine trends in Indian rainfall over the past half century in the context of long-term, low-frequency variability. We show that when generalized extreme value theory8,16,17,18is applied to annual maximum rainfall over India, no statistically significant spatially uniform trends are observed, in agreement with previous studies using different approaches2,3,4. Furthermore, our space–time regression analysis of the return levels points to increasing spatial variability of rainfall extremes over India. Our findings highlight the need for systematic examination of global versus regional drivers of trends in Indian rainfall extremes, and may help to inform flood hazard preparedness and water resource management in the region."
Microbial mediation of carbon-cycle feedbacks to climate warming,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1331,nature_articles/images_2011/Microbial mediation of carbon-cycle feedbacks to climate warming.jpg,A study based on a long-term manipulation experiment in a grassland ecosystem describes the microbial mechanisms controlling feedbacks to carbon and nutrient cycling under warming. The findings suggest that ecosystem models should more explicitly consider microbial feedbacks to climate change.,"Jizhong Zhou, Kai Xue, Yiqi Luo",No publication date,Letter,"Understanding the mechanisms of biospheric feedbacks to climate change is critical to project future climate warming1,2,3. Although microorganisms catalyse most biosphere processes related to fluxes of greenhouse gases, little is known about the microbial role in regulating future climate change4. Integrated metagenomic and functional analyses of a long-term warming experiment in a grassland ecosystem showed that microorganisms play crucial roles in regulating soil carbon dynamics through three primary feedback mechanisms: shifting microbial community composition, which most likely led to the reduced temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic soil respiration; differentially stimulating genes for degrading labile but not recalcitrant carbon so as to maintain long-term soil carbon stability and storage; and enhancing nutrient-cycling processes to promote plant nutrient-use efficiency and hence plant growth. Elucidating microbially mediated feedbacks is fundamental to understanding ecosystem responses to climate warming and provides a mechanistic basis for carbon–climate modelling."
Coral thermal tolerance shaped by local adaptation of photosymbionts,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1330,nature_articles/images_2011/Coral thermal tolerance shaped by local adaptation of photosymbionts.jpg,"An analysis shows that the coral endosymbiont Symbiodinium—a dinoflagellate genus underpinning the ecological and evolutionary success of reef corals—can adapt to local thermal regimes, thereby shaping the fitness of coral hosts. This may explain why many corals show fidelity for single Symbiodinium types over wide thermal ranges.","E. J. Howells, V. H. Beltran, M. J. H. van Oppen",No publication date,Letter,"Coral thermal tolerance is strongly influenced by the identity of obligate photosymbionts, which encompass numerous types belonging to the dinoflagellate genusSymbiodinium1. Physiological advantages achieved by partnering with functionally diverse symbionts2,3,4have been assumed to be available only to corals that can form associations with multipleSymbiodiniumtypes. Functional variation among populations of the same type ofSymbiodiniumhas been overlooked, despite local adaptation being feasible because of large population sizes5,6, genetic isolation7,8and short asexual generation times9. Here we demonstrate divergent thermal tolerance in a generalistSymbiodiniumtype from two different thermal environments.Symbiodiniumfrom the warmer reef maintained greater photo-chemical performance and survivorship when exposed to an elevated temperature of 32 °C, both in symbiosis and in culture. Juvenile corals associated withSymbiodiniumfrom the warmer reef grew rapidly when exposed to 32 °C, yet underwent bleaching and tissue death when associated withSymbiodiniumfrom the cooler reef. These results demonstrate thatSymbiodiniumtypes can adapt to local differences in thermal climate and that this adaptation shapes the fitness of coral hosts. IfSymbiodiniumpopulations are able to further adapt to increases in temperature at the pace at which ocean climates warm, they may assist corals to increase their thermal tolerance and persist into the future."
Effectiveness of stratospheric solar-radiation management as a function of climate sensitivity,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1328,nature_articles/images_2011/Effectiveness of stratospheric solar-radiation management as a function of climate sensitivity.jpg,"Perturbed-physics climate modelling experiments simulate past and future climate scenarios using a wide combination of model parameters consistent with past climate. Using such an approach, a study examines variations in the response of climate to solar-radiation management under different climate sensitivities.","Katharine L. Ricke, Daniel J. Rowlands, M. Granger Morgan",No publication date,Letter,"If implementation of proposals to engineer the climate through solar-radiation management (SRM) ever occurs, it is likely to be contingent on climate sensitivity. However, modelling studies examining the effectiveness of SRM as a strategy to offset anthropogenic climate change have used only the standard parameterizations of atmosphere–ocean general circulation models that yield climate sensitivities close to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project mean. Here, we use a perturbed-physics ensemble modelling experiment to examine how the response of the climate to SRM implemented in the stratosphere (SRM-S) varies under different greenhouse-gas climate sensitivities. When SRM-S is used to compensate for rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, its effectiveness in stabilizing regional climates diminishes with increasing climate sensitivity. However, the potential of SRM-S to slow down unmitigated climate change, even regionally, increases with climate sensitivity. On average, in variants of the model with higher sensitivity, SRM-S reduces regional rates of temperature change by more than 90% and rates of precipitation change by more than 50%."
Reduced early life growth and survival in a fish in direct response to increased carbon dioxide,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1291,nature_articles/images_2011/Reduced early life growth and survival in a fish in direct response to increased carbon dioxide.jpg,"Adult fish seem relatively resilient to increased carbon dioxide levels, but how early-life-stage fish fare remains less clear. In a study, the estuarine fish Menidia beryllina experienced severely reduced survival and growth rates in its early life stages under levels of ocean acidification expected later this century. This suggests that ocean acidification may affect fish populations, because small changes in early-life survival can generate large fluctuations in adult-fish abundance.","Hannes Baumann, Stephanie C. Talmage, Christopher J. Gobler",No publication date,Letter,"Absorption of anthropogenic carbon dioxide by the world’s oceans is causing mankind’s ‘other CO2problem’, ocean acidification1. Although this process will challenge marine organisms that synthesize calcareous exoskeletons or shells2,3,4,5,6, it is unclear how it will affect internally calcifying organisms, such as marine fish7. Adult fish tolerate short-term exposures to CO2levels that exceed those predicted for the next 300 years (∼2,000 ppm; ref.8), but potential effects of increased CO2on growth and survival during the early life stages of fish remain poorly understood7. Here we show that the exposure of early life stages of a common estuarine fish (Menidia beryllina) to CO2concentrations expected in the world’s oceans later this century caused severely reduced survival and growth rates. When compared with present-day CO2levels (∼400 ppm), exposure ofM. beryllinaembryos to∼1,000 ppm until one week post-hatch reduced average survival and length by 74% and 18%, respectively. The egg stage was significantly more vulnerable to high CO2-induced mortality than the post-hatch larval stage. These findings challenge the belief that ocean acidification will not affect fish populations, because even small changes in early life survival can generate large fluctuations in adult-fish abundance9,10."
Increased estimates of air-pollution emissions from Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1325,nature_articles/images_2011/Increased estimates of air-pollution emissions from Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol.jpg,"Biofuels are often promoted as a way of mitigating climate change, but their impacts on climate and air quality remain uncertain. Estimates of air-pollutant emissions from the production and use of sugar-cane ethanol in Brazil indicate that this biofuel may have larger impacts on regional climate and human health than previously thought.","C-C. Tsao, J. E. Campbell, Y. Chen",No publication date,Letter,"Accelerating biofuel production has been promoted as an opportunity to enhance energy security, offset greenhouse-gas emissions and support rural economies. However, large uncertainties remain in the impacts of biofuels on air quality and climate1,2. Sugar-cane ethanol is one of the most widely used biofuels, and Brazil is its largest producer3. Here we use a life-cycle approach to produce spatially and temporally explicit estimates of air-pollutant emissions over the whole life cycle of sugar-cane ethanol in Brazil. We show that even in regions where pre-harvest field burning has been eliminated on half the croplands, regional emissions of air pollutants continue to increase owing to the expansion of sugar-cane growing areas, and burning continues to be the dominant life-cycle stage for emissions. Comparison of our estimates of burning-phase emissions with satellite estimates of burning in São Paulo state suggests that sugar-cane field burning is not fully accounted for in satellite-based inventories, owing to the small spatial scale of individual fires. Accounting for this effect leads to revised regional estimates of burned area that are four times greater than some previous estimates. Our revised emissions maps thus suggest that biofuels may have larger impacts on regional climate forcing and human health than previously thought."
Severe tissue damage in Atlantic cod larvae under increasing ocean acidification,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1324,nature_articles/images_2011/Severe tissue damage in Atlantic cod larvae under increasing ocean acidification.jpg,"Ocean acidification—resulting from anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere—has been shown to affect fish growth rates and reproduction. Now research shows detrimental effects of ocean acidification on the development of Atlantic cod larvae—a mass-spawning fish species of high commercial importance—suggesting that ocean acidification could cause additional larval mortality, affecting populations of already exploited cod stocks.","Andrea Y. Frommel, Rommel Maneja, Catriona Clemmesen",No publication date,Letter,"Ocean acidification, caused by increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2(refs1,2,3), is one of the most critical anthropogenicthreats to marine life. Changes in seawater carbonate chemistry have the potential to disturb calcification, acid–base regulation, blood circulation and respiration, as well as the nervous system of marine organisms, leading to long-term effects such as reduced growth rates and reproduction4,5. In teleost fishes, early life-history stages are particularly vulnerable as they lack specialized internal pH regulatory mechanisms6,7. So far, impacts of relevant CO2concentrations on larval fish have been found in behaviour8,9and otolith size10,11, mainly in tropical, non-commercial species. Here we show detrimental effects of ocean acidification on the development of a mass-spawning fish species of high commercial importance. We reared Atlantic cod larvae at three levels of CO2, (1) present day, (2) end of next century and (3) an extreme, coastal upwelling scenario, in a long-term (months) mesocosm experiment. Exposure to CO2resulted in severe to lethal tissue damage in many internal organs, with the degree of damage increasing with CO2concentration. As larval survival is the bottleneck to recruitment, ocean acidification has the potential to act as an additional source of natural mortality, affecting populations of already exploited fish stocks."
Rapid transgenerational acclimation of a tropical reef fish to climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1323,nature_articles/images_2011/Rapid transgenerational acclimation of a tropical reef fish to climate change.jpg,"Tropical species are considered especially sensitive to climate change, but research now shows that a tropical reef fish can rapidly acclimate over multiple generations. Acute exposure to a 1.5 °C and 3.0 °C temperature rise decreased an individual’s ability to perform aerobic activities such as swimming or foraging by 15% and 30% respectively, but this did not occur when both parents and offspring were reared at the higher temperature.","J. M. Donelson, P. L. Munday, C. R. Pitcher",No publication date,Letter,"Understanding the capacity of species to acclimate and adapt to expected temperature increases is critical for making predictions about the biological impacts of global warming, yet it is one of the least certain aspects of climate change science1,2,3,4. Tropical species are considered to be especially sensitive to climate change because they live close to their thermal maximum and exhibit limited capacity for acclimation5,6,7. Here, we demonstrate that a tropical reef fish is highly sensitive to small increases in water temperature, but can rapidly acclimate over multiple generations. Acute exposure to elevated temperatures (+1.5 °C and +3.0 °C) predicted to occur this century caused a 15% and 30% respective decrease in individual’s maximum ability to perform aerobic activities such as swimming or foraging, known as aerobic scope. However, complete compensation in aerobic scope occurred when both parents and offspring were reared throughout their lives at elevated temperature. Such acclimation could reduce the impact of warming temperatures and allow populations to persist across their current range. This study reveals the importance of transgenerational acclimation as a mechanism for coping with rapid climate change and highlights that single generation studies risk underestimating the potential of species to cope."
Expansion of oxygen minimum zones may reduce available habitat for tropical pelagic fishes,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1304,nature_articles/images_2011/Expansion of oxygen minimum zones may reduce available habitat for tropical pelagic fishes.jpg,"One of the impacts of ocean warming is a decrease in dissolved oxygen, with implications for valuable pelagic fish species. A study shows that the oxygenated upper ocean layer in the tropical northeast Atlantic thinned at a rate of around one metre per year between 1960 and 2010, and, by tracking individually tagged fish, demonstrates that this contraction in the oxygenated layer limited the movement of blue marlin.","Lothar Stramma, Eric D. Prince, Arne Körtzinger",No publication date,Letter,"Climate model predictions1,2and observations3,4reveal regional declines in oceanic dissolved oxygen, which are probably influenced by global warming5. Studies indicate ongoing dissolved oxygen depletion and vertical expansion of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the tropical northeast Atlantic Ocean6,7. OMZ shoaling may restrict the usable habitat of billfishes and tunas to a narrow surface layer8,9. We report a decrease in the upper ocean layer exceeding 3.5 ml l−1dissolved oxygen at a rate of ≤1 m yr−1in the tropical northeast Atlantic (0–25° N, 12–30° W), amounting to an annual habitat loss of∼5.95×1013m3, or 15% for the period 1960–2010. Habitat compression and associated potential habitat loss was validated using electronic tagging data from 47 blue marlin. This phenomenon increases vulnerability to surface fishing gear for billfishes and tunas8,9, and may be associated with a 10–50% worldwide decline of pelagic predator diversity10. Further expansion of the Atlantic OMZ along with overfishing may threaten the sustainability of these valuable pelagic fisheries and marine ecosystems."
A drought-induced pervasive increase in tree mortality across Canada's boreal forests,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1293,nature_articles/images_2011/A drought-induced pervasive increase in tree mortality across Canada_s boreal forests.jpg,Drought-induced forest dieback has emerged as a global concern and is expected to increase worldwide under projected future climate change. A study using long-term forest plots now provides a quantitative estimate of drought-induced increase in tree mortality across Canada's boreal forests—one of the most important terrestrial carbon sinks.,"Changhui Peng, Zhihai Ma, Xiaolu Zhou",No publication date,Letter,"Drought-induced tree mortality is expected to increase worldwide under projected future climate changes1,2,3,4. The Canadian boreal forests, which occupy about 30% of the boreal forests worldwide and 77% of Canada's total forested land, play a critical role in the albedo of Earth’s surface5and in its global carbon budget6. Many of the previously reported regional-scale impacts of drought on tree mortality have affected low- and middle-latitude tropical regions2and the temperate forests of the western United States3, but no study has examined high-latitude boreal regions with multiple species at a regional scale using long-term forest permanent sampling plots7,8,9. Here, we estimated tree mortality in natural stands throughout Canada's boreal forests using data from the permanent sampling plots and statistical models. We found that tree mortality rates increased by an overall average of 4.7% yr−1from 1963 to 2008, with higher mortality rate increases in western regions than in eastern regions (about 4.9 and 1.9% yr−1, respectively). The water stress created by regional drought may be the dominant contributor to these widespread increases in tree mortality rates across tree species, sizes, elevations, longitudes and latitudes. Western Canada seems to have been more sensitive to drought than eastern Canada."
Support for climate policy and societal action are linked to perceptions about scientific agreement,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1295,nature_articles/images_2011/Support for climate policy and societal action are linked to perceptions about scientific agreement.jpg,A significant proportion of the US public believe that climate scientists widely disagree about climate change. Now a survey-based study investigates whether this misperception is important and finds that individuals who believe there is broad scientific disagreement tend to feel less certain that global warming is occurring and show less support for climate policy.,"Ding Ding, Edward W. Maibach, Anthony Leiserowitz",No publication date,Letter,"Although a majority of US citizens think that the president and Congress should address global warming, only a minority think it should be a high priority1. Previous research has shown that four key beliefs about climate change—that it is real, human caused, serious and solvable—are important predictors of support for climate policies2. Other research has shown that organized opponents of climate legislation have sought to undermine public support by instilling the belief that there is widespread disagreement among climate scientists about these points3—a view shown to be widely held by the public1. Here we examine if this misperception is consequential. We show that the misperception is strongly associated with reduced levels of policy support and injunctive beliefs (that is, beliefs that action should be taken to mitigate global warming). The relationship is mediated by the four previously identified key beliefs about climate change, especially people’s certainty that global warming is occurring. In short, people who believe that scientists disagree on global warming tend to feel less certain that global warming is occurring, and show less support for climate policy. This suggests the potential importance of correcting the widely held public misperception about lack of scientific agreement on global warming."
Long-term climate implications of twenty-first century options for carbon dioxide emission mitigation,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1302,nature_articles/images_2011/Long-term climate implications of twenty-first century options for carbon dioxide emission mitigation.jpg,"Decisions about how soon, how quickly and by how much carbon dioxide emissions are reduced will determine whether the climate target of limiting warming to 2 °C can be met. Research reveals that it will probably only be possible if ambitious reductions are implemented within the next two decades and emissions eventually fall to zero.","P. Friedlingstein, S. Solomon, M. R. Raupach",No publication date,Letter,"Long-term future warming is primarily constrained by cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide1,2,3,4. Previous studies have estimated that humankind has already emitted about 50% of the total amount allowed if warming, relative to pre-industrial, is to stay below 2 °C (refs1,2). Carbon dioxide emissions will thus need to decrease substantially in the future if this target is to be met. Here we show how links between near-term decisions, long-term behaviour and climate sensitivity uncertainties constrain options for emissions mitigation. Using a model of intermediate complexity5,6, we explore the implications of non-zero long-term global emissions, combined with various near-term mitigation rates or delays in action. For a median climate sensitivity, a long-term 90% emission reduction relative to the present-day level is incompatible with a 2 °C target within the coming millennium. Zero or negative emissions can be compatible with the target if medium to high emission-reduction rates begin within the next two decades. For a high climate sensitivity, however, even negative emissions would require a global mitigation rate at least as great as the highest rate considered feasible by economic models7,8to be implemented within the coming decade. Only a low climate sensitivity would allow for a longer delay in mitigation action and a more conservative mitigation rate, and would still require at least 90% phase-out of emissions thereafter."
Importance of background climate in determining impact of land-cover change on regional climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1294,nature_articles/images_2011/Importance of background climate in determining impact of land-cover change on regional climate.jpg,Both greenhouse gas emissions and changes in land use and cover have modified the Earth’s climate since preindustrial times. A modelling study now shows that the impact of land-cover change on regional climate depends critically on how snow cover and rainfall change under increased greenhouse gases.,"A. J. Pitman, F. B. Avila, N. de Noblet-Ducoudré",No publication date,Letter,"Humans have modified the Earth’s climate through emissions of greenhouse gases and through land-use and land-cover change (LULCC)1. Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere warm the mid-latitudes more than the tropics, in part owing to a reduced snow–albedo feedback as snow cover decreases2. Higher concentration of carbon dioxide also increases precipitation in many regions1, as a result of an intensification of the hydrological cycle2. The biophysical effects of LULCC since pre-industrial times have probably cooled temperate and boreal regions and warmed some tropical regions3. Here we use a climate model to show that how snow and rainfall change under increased greenhouse gases dominates how LULCC affects regional temperature. Increased greenhouse-gas-driven changes in snow and rainfall affect the snow–albedo feedback and the supply of water, which in turn limits evaporation. These changes largely control the net impact of LULCC on regional climate. Our results show that capturing whether future biophysical changes due to LULCC warm or cool a specific region therefore requires an accurate simulation of changes in snow cover and rainfall geographically coincident with regions of LULCC. This is a challenge to current climate models, but also provides potential for further improving detection and attribution methods."
Ocean carbon uptake and storage influenced by wind bias in global climate models,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1289,nature_articles/images_2011/Ocean carbon uptake and storage influenced by wind bias in global climate models.jpg,"Global climate models have a well-known bias in the position and strength of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds. Research reveals that this bias increases carbon uptake by the ocean, reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, in climate model simulations—a result that should help constrain uncertainties in climate model projections.","N. C. Swart, J. C. Fyfe",No publication date,Letter,"In global climate model pre-industrial control simulations the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds show a systematic bias in position and strength relative to estimates of their actual position and strength. These wind-stress biases impact the simulated transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current1and the nature of Southern Ocean water-mass formation1and may affect the rate of meridional overturning of the global ocean2. The effect they have on oceanic carbon uptake and storage is unknown, however. Here we demonstrate, using a coupled carbon–climate model3, that the wind-stress biases reduce equilibrium ocean carbon storage, redistribute carbon within the ocean and increase oceanic carbon uptake in climate change simulations. The wind-stress biases act directly by influencing Ekman pumping dynamics in the Southern Ocean and also seem to have an indirect effect on the overturning circulation and carbon distribution through the Agulhas leakage and Indo–Atlantic salt flux. Our results indicate that carbon–climate model simulations with the typical pre-industrial wind-stress bias will over-estimate ocean carbon sequestration, and thereby under-estimate atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the twenty-first century, relative to unbiased simulations. The new generation of coupled carbon–climate models may be subject to these wind biases, which could alter their carbon–climate response, although it is worth noting that the uncertainty arising from wind biases that we demonstrate here is one of several uncertainties that affect modelled ocean carbon uptake4."
Emission pathways consistent with a 2 °C global temperature limit,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1258,nature_articles/images_2011/Emission pathways consistent with a 2__C global temperature limit.jpg,The ‘pathway’ the world needs to follow to limit global temperature rise to 2 °C remains uncertain. Analysis that takes technical and economic constraints on reducing emissions into account indicates that emissions need to peak in the next decade and then fall rapidly to have a good chance of achieving this goal.,"Joeri Rogelj, William Hare, Malte Meinshausen",No publication date,Letter,"In recent years, international climate policy has increasingly focused on limiting temperature rise, as opposed to achieving greenhouse-gas-concentration-related objectives. The agreements reached at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change conference in Cancun in 2010 recognize that countries should take urgent action to limit the increase in global average temperature to less than 2 °C relative to pre-industrial levels1. If this is to be achieved, policymakers need robust information about the amounts of future greenhouse-gas emissions that are consistent with such temperature limits. This, in turn, requires an understanding of both the technical and economic implications of reducing emissions and the processes that link emissions to temperature. Here we consider both of these aspects by reanalysing a large set of published emission scenarios from integrated assessment models in a risk-based climate modelling framework. We find that in the set of scenarios with a ‘likely’ (greater than 66%) chance of staying below 2 °C, emissions peak between 2010 and 2020 and fall to a median level of 44 Gt of CO2equivalent in 2020 (compared with estimated median emissions across the scenario set of 48 Gt of CO2equivalent in 2010). Our analysis confirms that if the mechanisms needed to enable an early peak in global emissions followed by steep reductions are not put in place, there is a significant risk that the 2 °C target will not be achieved."
Regional carbon dioxide implications of forest bioenergy production,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1264,nature_articles/images_2011/Regional carbon dioxide implications of forest bioenergy production.jpg,"Substituting fossil fuels with bioenergy from forests, as well as thinning forests to reduce wildfire emissions, has been proposed as a means of cutting carbon dioxide emissions.

Hudiburg, Beverly E. Law, Sebastiaan Luyssaert",No publication date,Letter,"Strategies for reducing carbon dioxide emissions include substitution of fossil fuel with bioenergy from forests1, where carbon emitted is expected to be recaptured in the growth of new biomass to achieve zero net emissions2, and forest thinning to reduce wildfire emissions3. Here, we use forest inventory data to show that fire prevention measures and large-scale bioenergy harvest in US West Coast forests lead to 2–14% (46–405 Tg C) higher emissions compared with current management practices over the next 20 years. We studied 80 forest types in 19 ecoregions, and found that the current carbon sink in 16 of these ecoregions is sufficiently strong that it cannot be matched or exceeded through substitution of fossil fuels by forest bioenergy. If the sink in these ecoregions weakens below its current level by 30–60 g C m−2yr−1owing to insect infestations, increased fire emissions or reduced primary production, management schemes including bioenergy production may succeed in jointly reducing fire risk and carbon emissions. In the remaining three ecoregions, immediate implementation of fire prevention and biofuel policies may yield net emission savings. Hence, forest policy should consider current forest carbon balance, local forest conditions and ecosystem sustainability in establishing how to decrease emissions."
Reduced survival of Antarctic benthos linked to climate-induced iceberg scouring,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1232,nature_articles/images_2011/Reduced survival of Antarctic benthos linked to climate-induced iceberg scouring.jpg,"The West Antarctic Peninsula has experienced rapid warming in recent decades. One of the effects has been a loss of the ‘fast-ice’ skin, or frozen layer, that forms on the sea surface each winter and reduces seabed scouring. A study now links increased seabed scouring over the past 25 years to higher benthic mortality, with implications for the region’s biodiversity.","David K. A. Barnes, Terri Souster",No publication date,Letter,"The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a hotspot of recent rapid regional warming and ice loss1. The WAP sea surface freezes each winter to form a ‘fast-ice’ skin that can reduce iceberg drift and collisions between their keels and the sea bed, in what is termed scouring. Scouring disturbance is thus inversely correlated with fast-ice duration2. We examined long-term records of fast ice, ice scour and mortality of benthos around Rothera research station (WAP) to determine whether there is a biological response from the sea bed coincident with fast-ice changes. Here we show that the duration of fast ice at Rothera has significantly decreased by >5 d yr−1over 25 years and that this is strongly correlated with increased ice scour and mortality of benthos in the shallows. The number of experimental markers at Rothera crushed by iceberg scouring increased over the past decade. We found that survival of one of the most common shallow species3, the bryozoanFenestrulina rugula, is linked to ice-scour frequency and has markedly decreased over the past 12 years. The chance of colonies reaching two years old, the age at which they typically begin to sexually reproduce, has halved since 1997. These findings suggest that increased scouring of the sea bed has led to higher benthic mortality, with implications for the region’s biodiversity."
Ecological–economic optimization of biodiversity conservation under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1227,nature_articles/images_2011/Ecological_economic optimization of biodiversity conservation under climate change.jpg,Little information exists to guide conservation planning under climate change uncertainty.

The research finds that the best conservation options vary nonlinearly with available budget.,"Brendan A. Wintle, Sarah A. Bekessy, Hugh P. Possingham",No publication date,Letter,"Substantial investment in climate change research has led to dire predictions of the impacts and risks to biodiversity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report1cites 28,586 studies demonstrating significant biological changes in terrestrial systems2. Already high extinction rates, driven primarily by habitat loss, are predicted to increase under climate change3,4,5,6. Yet there is little specific advice or precedent in the literature to guide climate adaptation investment for conserving biodiversity within realistic economic constraints7. Here we present a systematic ecological and economic analysis of a climate adaptation problem in one of the world’s most species-rich and threatened ecosystems: the South African fynbos. We discover a counterintuitive optimal investment strategy that switches twice between options as the available adaptation budget increases. We demonstrate that optimal investment is nonlinearly dependent on available resources, making the choice of how much to invest as important as determining where to invest and what actions to take. Our study emphasizes the importance of a sound analytical framework for prioritizing adaptation investments4. Integrating ecological predictions in an economic decision framework will help support complex choices between adaptation options under severe uncertainty. Our prioritization method can be applied at any scale to minimize species loss and to evaluate the robustness of decisions to uncertainty about key assumptions."
Model-based evidence of deep-ocean heat uptake during surface-temperature hiatus periods,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1229,nature_articles/images_2011/Model-based evidence of deep-ocean heat uptake during surface-temperature hiatus periods.jpg,"In some decades, such as 2000–2009, the observed globally averaged surface-temperature time series has shown a flat or slightly negative trend.

However, the observed energy imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere for this recent decade indicates that a net energy flux into the climate system of about 1 W m−2(refs2,3) should be producing warming somewhere in the system4,5. Here we analyse twenty-first-century climate-model simulations that maintain a consistent radiative imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere of about 1 W m−2as observed for the past decade. Eight decades with a slightly negative global mean surface-temperature trend show that the ocean above 300 m takes up significantly less heat whereas the ocean below 300 m takes up significantly more, compared with non-hiatus decades. The model provides a plausible depiction of processes in the climate system causing the hiatus periods, and indicates that a hiatus period is a relatively common climate phenomenon and may be linked to La Niña-like conditions."
Cryptic biodiversity loss linked to global climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1191,nature_articles/images_2011/Cryptic biodiversity loss linked to global climate change.jpg,Climate impacts on biodiversity are usually assessed at the morphospecies level. An analysis of the distribution and mitochondrial DNA variability of nine montane aquatic insect species in Europe suggests range contractions will be accompanied by severe loss of genetic diversity. These results imply that morphospecies-scale assessments may greatly underestimate potential biodiversity losses from climate change.,"M. Bálint, S. Domisch, C. Nowak",No publication date,Letter,"Global climate change (GCC) significantly affects distributional patterns of organisms1, and considerable impacts on biodiversity are predicted for the next decades. Inferred effects include large-scale range shifts towards higher altitudes and latitudes2, facilitation of biological invasions3and species extinctions1,3. Alterations of biotic patterns caused by GCC have usually been predicted on the scale of taxonomically recognized morphospecies1. However, the effects of climate change at the most fundamental level of biodiversity—intraspecific genetic diversity—remain elusive4. Here we show that the use of morphospecies-based assessments of GCC effects will result in underestimations of the true scale of biodiversity loss. Species distribution modelling and assessments of mitochondrial DNA variability in nine montane aquatic insect species in Europe indicate that future range contractions will be accompanied by severe losses of cryptic evolutionary lineages and genetic diversity within these lineages. These losses greatly exceed those at the scale of morphospecies. We also document that the extent of range reduction may be a useful proxy when predicting losses of genetic diversity. Our results demonstrate that intraspecific patterns of genetic diversity should be considered when estimating the effects of climate change on biodiversity."

An analysis of Mediterranean corals and molluscs now shows that the ability to continue shell and skeleton growth in corrosive seawater is determined in part by the existence of outer organic protective layers. High temperatures, however, modify resistance to acidification.","R. Rodolfo-Metalpa, F. Houlbrèque, J. M.

This rapid acidification is predicted to dramatically decrease calcification in many marine organisms3,4. Reduced skeletal growth under increased CO2levels has already been shown for corals, molluscs and many other marine organisms4,5,6,7,8,9. The impact of acidification on the ability of individual species to calcify has remained elusive, however, as measuring net calcification fails to disentangle the relative contributions of gross calcification and dissolution rates on growth. Here, we show that corals and molluscs transplanted along gradients of carbonate saturation state at Mediterranean CO2vents are able to calcify and grow at even faster than normal rates when exposed to the high CO2levels projected for the next 300 years. Calcifiers remain at risk, however, owing to the dissolution of exposed shells and skeletons that occurs as pH levels fall. Our results show that tissues and external organic layers play a major role in protecting shells and skeletons from corrosive sea water, limiting dissolution and allowing organisms to calcify10,11. Our combined field and laboratory results demonstrate that the adverse effects of global warming are exacerbated when high temperatures coincide with acidification."
Soil carbon release enhanced by increased tropical forest litterfall,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1190,nature_articles/images_2011/Soil carbon release enhanced by increased tropical forest litterfall.jpg,"Enhanced tropical forest productivity, facilitated by increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, could act as a substantial carbon sink.

However, the carbon sequestration capacity of tropical forest soils is uncertain and feedbacks between increased plant productivity and soil carbon dynamics remain unexplored5,6. Here, we show that experimentally increasing litterfall in a lowland tropical forest enhanced carbon release from the soil. Using a large-scale litter manipulation experiment combined with carbon isotope measurements, we found that the efflux of CO2derived from soil organic carbon was significantly increased by litter addition. Furthermore, this effect was sustained over several years. We predict that a future increase in litterfall of 30% with an increase in atmospheric CO2concentrations of 150 ppm could release about 0.6 t C ha−1yr−1from the soil, partially offsetting predicted net gains in carbon storage. Thus, it is essential that plant–soil feedbacks are taken into account in predictions of the carbon sequestration potential of tropical forests."
Optimal timing for managed relocation of species faced with climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1170,nature_articles/images_2011/Optimal timing for managed relocation of species faced with climate change.jpg,"Managed relocation, whereby species are moved to a more suitable habitat, has been proposed as a means of combating negative climate-change impacts on biodiversity.

To inform these moves, we construct a quantitative decision framework to evaluate the timing of relocation in the face of climate change. We find that the optimal timing depends on many factors, including the size of the population, the demographic costs of translocation and the expected carrying capacities over time in the source and destination habitats. In some settings, such as when a small population would benefit from time to grow before risking translocation losses, haste is ill advised. We also find that active adaptive management15,16is valuable when the effect of climate change on source habitat is uncertain, and leads to delayed movement."
Revolatilization of persistent organic pollutants in the Arctic induced by climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1167,nature_articles/images_2011/Revolatilization of persistent organic pollutants in the Arctic induced by climate change.jpg,"The abundance of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Arctic atmosphere has decreased over recent decades owing to international restrictions and regulations.

They include industrial chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. Owing to their persistence in the environment, POPs are transported long distances in the atmosphere, accumulating in regions such as the Arctic, where low temperatures induce their deposition1,2. Here the compounds accumulate in wildlife and humans, putting their health at risk1,3,4. The concentrations of many POPs have decreased in Arctic air over the past few decades owing to restrictions on their production and use. As the climate warms, however, POPs deposited in sinks such as water and ice are expected to revolatilize into the atmosphere5, and there is evidence that this process may have already begun for volatile compounds6. Here we show that many POPs, including those with lower volatilities, are being remobilized into the air from repositories in the Arctic region as a result of sea-ice retreat and rising temperatures. We analysed records of the concentrations of POPs in Arctic air since the early 1990s and compared the results with model simulations of the effect of climate change on their atmospheric abundances. Our results indicate that a wide range of POPs have been remobilized into the Arctic atmosphere over the past two decades as a result of climate change, confirming that Arctic warming could undermine global efforts to reduce environmental and human exposure to these toxic chemicals."
An energetic perspective on the regional response of precipitation to climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1169,nature_articles/images_2011/An energetic perspective on the regional response of precipitation to climate change.jpg,"The hydrological cycle is ultimately driven by solar energy, so it is not surprising that energy constraints affect the response of rainfall to climate change at a global level.

O’Gorman",No publication date,Letter,"Understanding and predicting the response of the hydrological cycle to climate change is a major challenge with important societal implications. Much progress has been made in understanding the response of global average precipitation by considering the energy balances of the atmosphere and the surface1,2,3,4,5,6. This energetic perspective reveals that changes in temperature, greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar forcing and cloud feedbacks can all affect the global average rate of precipitation5,7,8,9,10,11. Local precipitation changes have conventionally been analysed using the water vapour budget, but here we show that the energetic approach can be extended to local changes in precipitation by including changes in horizontal energy transport. In simulations of twenty-first century climate change, this energy transport accounts for much of the spatial variability in precipitation change. We show that changes in radiative and surface sensible heat fluxes are a guide to the local precipitation response over land and at large scales, but not at small scales over the ocean, where cloud and water vapour radiative feedbacks dampen the response. The energetic approach described here helps bridge the gap between our understanding of global and regional precipitation changes. It could be applied to better understand the response of regional precipitation to different radiative forcings, including geo-engineering schemes, as well as to understand the differences between the fast and slow responses of regional precipitation to such forcings."

Diseases are also known to be important for the structure and function of food webs10,11,12,13,14. However, the role of plant diseases in modulating ecosystem responses to a changing climate is poorly understood15,16. This is partly because disease outbreaks are relatively rare and spatially variable, such that that their effects can only be captured in long-term experiments. Here we show that, although plant growth was favoured by the insulating effects of increased snow cover in experimental plots in Sweden, plant biomass decreased over the seven-year study. The decline in biomass was caused by an outbreak of a host-specific parasitic fungus,Arwidssonia empetri, which killed the majority of the shoots of the dominant plant species,Empetrum hermaphroditum, after six years of increased snow cover. After the outbreak of the disease, instantaneous measurements of gross photosynthesis and net ecosystem carbon exchange were significantly reduced at midday during the growing season. Our results show that plant diseases can alter and even reverse the effects of a changing climate on tundra carbon balance by altering plant composition."
Implementation and opportunity costs of reducing deforestation and forest degradation in Tanzania,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1119,nature_articles/images_2011/Implementation and opportunity costs of reducing deforestation and forest degradation in Tanzania.jpg,Preventing deforestation—a key goal of international climate policy—can incur an opportunity cost for local communities who depend on forest resources for their livelihoods.

However, most REDD+ analysis has used coarse-scale data, overlooked important opportunity costs to tropical forest users4,5and failed to consider how to best invest funds to limit leakage, that is, merely displacing deforestation6. Here we examine these issues for Tanzania, a REDD+ country, by comparing district-scale carbon losses from deforestation with the opportunity costs of carbon conservation. Opportunity costs are estimated as rents from both agriculture and charcoal production (the most important proximate causes of regional forest conversion7,8,9). As an alternative we also calculate the implementation costs of alleviating the demand for forest conversion—thereby addressing the problem of leakage—by raising agricultural yields on existing cropland and increasing charcoal fuel-use efficiency. The implementation costs exceed the opportunity costs of carbon conservation (medians of US$6.50 versus US$3.90 per Mg CO2), so effective REDD+ policies may cost more than simpler estimates suggest. However, even if agricultural yields are doubled, implementation is possible at the competitive price of∼US$12 per Mg CO2."

All eight Arctic states are projected to suffer steep declines (−11 to −82%) in accessibility inland, driven by lost potential for winter road construction caused by milder winters and deeper snow accumulation."

We investigated coral reefs, seagrasses and sediments that are acclimatized to low pH at three cool and shallow volcanic carbon dioxide seeps in Papua New Guinea. At reduced pH, we observed reductions in coral diversity, recruitment and abundances of structurally complex framework builders, and shifts in competitive interactions between taxa. However, coral cover remained constant between pH 8.1 and∼7.8, because massivePoritescorals established dominance over structural corals, despite low rates of calcification. Reef development ceased below pH 7.7. Our empirical data from this unique field setting confirm model predictions that ocean acidification, together with temperature stress, will probably lead to severely reduced diversity, structural complexity and resilience of Indo-Pacific coral reefs within this century."

Here we use the North American Drought Atlas9,10—a database of drought reconstructions based on tree-ring records—to produce a continuous, annually resolved record of ENSO variability over the past 1,100 years. Our record is in broad agreement with independent, ENSO-sensitive proxy records in the Pacific and surrounding regions. Together, these records indicate that ENSO amplitude exhibits a quasi-regular cycle of 50–90 years that is closely coupled to the tropical Pacific mean state. Anomalously warm conditions in the eastern Pacific are associated with enhanced ENSO variability, consistent with model simulations11. The quasi-periodic ENSO amplitude modulation reported here offers a key observational constraint for improving models and their prediction of ENSO behaviour linked to global warming."

Their expansion is enhanced by climate warming, which boosts methane emission and contributes a positive feedback to future climate change3,4,8. Modelling of thaw-lake growth is necessary to quantify this feedback. Here, we present a two-dimensional landscape-scale model that includes the entire life cycle of thaw lakes; initiation, expansion, drainage and eventual re-initiation. Application of our model to past and future lake expansion in northern Siberia shows that lake drainage strongly limits lake expansion, even under conditions of continuous permafrost. Our results suggest that methane emissions from thaw lakes in Siberia are an order of magnitude less alarming than previously suggested, although predicted lake expansion will still profoundly affect permafrost ecosystems and infrastructure."

We estimated changes in the species’ growth rate over a 90-year period using otoliths—bony structures that fish use for orientation and detection of movement—and compared these changes to temperature trends across the species’ distribution. Increasing temperatures coincide with increased growth for populations in the middle of the species range, but with reduced growth for those at the warm northern edge of the species’ distribution, indicating that temperatures may have already reached levels associated with increased metabolic costs. If warming continues, the direct metabolic effects of increasing temperatures on this species may lead to declining productivity and range contraction."

Although the predominant view is that only inorganic and amino acid N are important sources of N for angiosperms, most N enters soil as protein. Maritime Antarctic soils have large stocks of proteinaceous N, which is released slowly as decomposition is limited by low temperatures. Consequently, an ability to acquire N at an early stage of availability is key to the success of photosynthetic organisms. Here we show thatD. antarcticacan acquire N through its roots as short peptides, produced at an early stage of protein decomposition, acquiring N over three times faster than as amino acid, nitrate or ammonium, and more than 160 times faster than the mosses with which it competes. Efficient acquisition of the N released in faster decomposition of soil organic matter as temperatures rise14may giveD. antarcticaan advantage over competing mosses that has facilitated its recent proliferation in the maritime Antarctic."

So far, the evidence available to test this hypothesis is limited, and in part contradictory1,2,3,4. Here we use national survey data collected from 1,822 individuals across the UK in 2010, to examine the links between direct flooding experience, perceptions of climate change and preparedness to reduce energy use.

Importantly, these perceptual differences also translate into a greater willingness to save energy to mitigate climate change. Highlighting links between local weather events and climate change is therefore likely to be a useful strategy for increasing concern and action."

Past studies have relied mainly on crop-simulation models1,2or statistical analyses based on reported harvest data3,4, each with considerable uncertainties and limited applicability to tropical systems. However, a wealth of historical crop-trial data exists in the tropics that has been previously untapped for climate research. Using a data set of more than 20,000 historical maize trials in Africa, combined with daily weather data, we show a nonlinear relationship between warming and yields. Each degree day spent above 30 °C reduced the final yield by 1% under optimal rain-fed conditions, and by 1.7% under drought conditions. These results are consistent with studies of temperate maize germplasm in other regions, and indicate the key role of moisture in maize’s ability to cope with heat. Roughly 65% of present maize-growing areas in Africa would experience yield losses for 1 °C of warming under optimal rain-fed management, with 100% of areas harmed by warming under drought conditions.
